Fuck it messes with my brain how long I‚Äôve gone without basic contact. \n\nI‚Äôm not even weird or consider myself ugly, I just have this stupid mental illness which makes me isolate, push people out and not form connections. And I cant stop. \n\nWhen I HAVE to socialise, I suddenly adopt this persona where I am super friendly and easy going. It‚Äôs so exhausting. I‚Äôm doomed to be lonely because I‚Äôm constantly tired of keeping up appearances. \n\nI can‚Äôt get out of the cycle. I can‚Äôt even bring myself to end it. I just exist for no reason.
