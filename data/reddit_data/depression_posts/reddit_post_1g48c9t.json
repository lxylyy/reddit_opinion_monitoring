I asked my therapist why he wants to be alive, but nothing he told me seemed so fulfilling that it makes sense to keep going. I don't understand why most people don't want to die when life objectively sucks so much",

But in my case my healing from depression and suicide started through two points: 1) I just got sick of myself always choosing to be the suffering victim of everything around me, 2) When thinking about what is actually worth living for, I went wayyy back into my memories of childhood and took up on things I used to love; these are now an essential part of my life, private and professional, and I genuinely take joy in doing them. When you are in such a vulnerable and miserable place, it is important to not only do „healthy“ activities, but also make sure that you are doing enough of „healthy“ activities that bring you joy. F.e. pilates is healthy, i tried it and tbh lowkey hated it. But doing martial arts genuinely brings me joy and I enjoy almost every second of it. You should also try regularly something new, even if it is small. Look into spirituality if this could be something for you. Attempting to actively improve your thinking is also much more productive than relying on medication. There is also so much literature on depression that you could read. Depression and suicidal thoughts require work, constant work. And you owe this work to yourself because you’re the one who can make you happy xxx",

Somewhere I read a phrase that said \"This shall pass too..\" You may not see it now or can't imagine, but It will get better. I don't know how you got to that point but for me it has been years of struggling with that feeling.\n\nI went to therapy 3 times and something still felt wrong. That's when I went to the psychiatrist, started medication and a therapy that worked for me. I got to a dark place after my father passed away. When I got help I discovered that I have Adhd and probably ASD, this combined with years of abuse made me really depressed and anxious.\n\nIf a had to make a summary of the things that were wrong with me and I have learned in therapy:\n-I used to live to follow the standards of other people. One day I woke up and found out that the life I was living didn't felt like mine. \n\n-When I was young I was not allowed to express my emotions, specially sadness and anger. My mother abused me verbally, critized everything I did. I didn't have anyone that could help me, I was alone with her all day. I couldnt even express my emotions. I just had to be that perfect girl that didn't upset anyone. \n\n-Because I have ADHD I am clumsy, sports were hard for me, when I tried to help my mother with something, I Made a mistake and she got really mad at me. I grew up feeling like I was useless, and the only thing that I was good at, was School. So if I failed in anyway with that, then I would suck at everything. So I was really unhappy at college, It was a horrible environment but I would stand It so that I don't get called a useless person.\n\n-I didn't put limits. I was a person who learn to just be a happy girl, not express my emotions and Don't upset everyone. Trying to be perfect so my mother wont say horrible stuff to me. So I didn't put limits to anyone and I couldnt defend myself. This took me to horrible situations and people. I was harassed by a lot of people, I was in danger a lot of times because of this. I got to the point where I could defend myself. \n\n-I thought that showing my feelings Made me vulnerable but now I don't see It that way. I still have trouble to cry in front of someone. \n\n-I choose myself over people. And I am learning to stand for myself. I have more confidence and now I tell myself that people enjoys what I do (and if they don't, I don't care, Im still going to do It). \n\n\n-I am accepting myself with everything that comes and I am becoming the person I wish that took care of me when I was younger. I am going to be safe. \n\n-Be kind with yourself, having a disability Made me realize that I have to live to my own standards, not just other people standards. I have to be compassionate and go at my own pace.\n\nThere are More things that I have learned but I think that these were the most important. Hope that It helps and that you can find More insights on therapy.\n\nWhat makes me live are small things such as watching the sunrise, enjoying the nature, having that  workout routine and watching my body being capable of more, eating something delicious, having an ice cream once in a while, doing some art and design. I just live for the day. Terrible things happened to me and they hurt sometimes but not all the time, I am working on that. I think that the reason why all this happened to me Is so that I can tell my story and help someone to prevent this. This also inspires me to create a world where people don't have to go through the same struggles I had.",
