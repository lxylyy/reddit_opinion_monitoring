I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for her. I have no way of supporting or taking care of myself. I am riddled with suicidal thoughts and depression and she worked hard my entire life to support and take care of me. I have no job, I'll lose the house we rent, I can't afford anything myself. She did everything for me. I dont even know how to make a doctors appointment myself. I don't know what to do. I've always told myself that when she dies I'll just kill myself and thats all I can think of right now. My entire family was here all day and I had to pretend that I'll be okay, but I know I wont. Once everyone left I completely broke. I don't know what to do.",

I still had my dad but he was an emotionally/verbally abusive alcoholic, we didn't have the best finances, then he passed away a year & 4 months later, at which point i was forced to move from the house my parents rented for 18+ years with no money, almost nowhere to go & almost no useful life skills as my parents (especially my mom) did all the driving & most of the cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc. Everything from my mom passing in 2017 until late 2019 (when my life finally started to improve a little) were the absolute worst, most stressful moments of my life.\n\n...When my mom passed i had to take care of my dad, when my dad passed i took care of my granny for a couple months til i got my low income place, & it was my first time in over a year & a half with no one to take care of, first time living alone & first time having to find my own daily routine in life, & it was at that point i lost it mentally & emotionally. I remember one breakdown i was crying especially hard & honestly wishing someone would break in & put me out of my misery cause i didn't have the nerve to do anything to myself. So i sorta know what it feels rather alone after a loss of someone so important 😭",

The death of someone's mother is one of the very most traumatic experiences anyone ever has - no matter how healthy and capable you are, there is very little worse than losing your mother. It's more unusual not to need help and support. I'm sure someone will understand and be willing to help. \n\nMy family is pretty shitty, and would probably come in criticizing, but they'd still show up and help. They'd probably criticize your mother for letting you get to 29 without life skills, but that's actually a valid criticism - sweet child, you are capable of more than you've been asked to do, and once you've started stretching, you'll see there's a healing and satisfaction in doing scary things for yourself. \n\nAre you in the United States? If so, start by calling United Way 211 and asking where to get help in your area. \n\nDid your mother have any friends who seem safe to you? Call someone and admit you're drowning.
