I wish I'd made up some excuse about being ill in some other way.\n\nIt's the absolute worst advice to reach out to friends about it, they're just not equipped to handle it, and they think you're reaching out to them for their support (when in reality you just want them to know, to understand, and to apologise for your absence). Reach out to parents, family, and seek therapy. But unless you have a friend who is knowledgeable, leave other friends out of it. Just tell them that you've got a vague illness and apologise for your absence. Don't tell them you have a mental illness, it's an invisible scary taboo condition and the fear it instills in others will ruin your relationships.\n\nI never wanted to tell my friends about it, I never wanted to trouble them or be a burden. Now I'm being shut out by them and I feel the exact thing I feared in the first place. Being a burden.\n\nTalk to family. Talk to a therapist. Talk to others on here. But leave your friends out.\n\nOP, I hope you feel better soon. I am struggling, and losing almost all my friends has been the cherry on top. Depression has ruined my life.

My childhood was back during the 1980s, and, although some things were not pleasant, most of the time, my life back then was much happier than my current \"existence\" (if I can even call it that).\n\nOne thing I'm unable to do, no matter how miserable my life is, is take my own life.  I often threaten to do that when I have really bad days, but the thought of ending my life is too terrible and terrifying for me to go through with it.

It's been hard I've decided that I'm being denied care because there's something wrong with me or they don't like me and it's personal. \n\nOnly that's not true either they don't care. What I had a mother and father that used to neglect my symptoms I realized that I valued my mental health or my personal feelings in a different way and my caregivers didn't value me and didn't try and help me but I'm my own mother and father to get my own help I'm disabled as well. So this is a conundrum for me to navigate and I asked these doctors can't I go to pain management where I don't have to find a car ride for it? I'm afraid to get into the car I am afraid to be driven anywhere I'm afraid of driving. My car wreck 14 months ago and being homeless for a few months has ruined my life. I'm ruined why am I being punished why am I being sent on a confusing gas lighting routine that reminds me of the neglect and refusal to care that my parents did to me I resent my mother and father and I resent professionals for not helping me because that's three parties that are let Downs complete letdowns.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with seeking help earlier this week this professional was confused and on a blame mode of telling me that I'm the problem and that I mentally ill and I said yeah I'm a bipolar failure to thrive case I need my medication here are two illnesses and here are three medications for it where are my medicines? And that's where they are they don't want to help me and they want to see where I disabilize and where I fail\n\nThey want me to fail is what I concluded so here I am disabled from bipolar and the doctors tell me that I'm the problem with all of these labels? Then I get care for over 20-30 years and now they want to mess around with it and remove care and change care. yeah okay life is full of change.\n\nI've also noticed that I'm being asked to be tough and strong and carry all of this and I can't and that's why I take medicine it's so strange that I have to keep on repeating myself and explaining myself about the same things that I keep managing decade after decade and why? Because this is where it is I can't help it I am a broken person that keeps on asking for help in a place in a nation that doesn't want to help anybody. They want to blame everybody make fun of everybody tell me it doesn't exist. Uses denialism or declinism\n\nNarcissism recovery coursework from YouTube helps me cope with mental health professionals they have a God complex they believe or they stigmatize everybody that there are drug user or crazy person and I don't have time to go back to the 1950s but since I live in the 1950s I just figure okay I'm a woman I'm a piece of garbage??? Is that what I'm supposed to think? No it's just a holding pattern over medical Care. Every year every decade every fad every little dinky inexperienced unqualified professional and not even making $8 an hour is going to tell me about mania or depression they really can sit down and shut up. Because they don't know anything.\n\nIn jest, I've learned with mental health care the last year that I'm a piece of garbageüòÇü§£üëÜ‚òùÔ∏èüÜôüßµ and that's the complete opposite of what I've experienced that's where I know that my mental health care is being removed from me and they are destabilizing me and they hate me. Because there's no reason to keep on making me suffer and to ignore me I'm being ignored and so are the rest of you these are the common routine existing concerns to take in stride and to carry.\n\nHow in 2024 and I'm being asked to suffer. It's not okay that this post is at Reddit and we are all here talking about our experiences üòÇü§£üí©ü§£üòÇin the removal and the rejection of care. \n\nI don't have time and neither do you to live in a place of suspended reality or a delusion where it's the person's fault for seeking pain management I am not strong I needed management and I needed my medication giving back to me my anxiety and insomnia is unbearable however I keep carrying it because I'm not giving up on myself..I am experienced with parents and family neglect so when I experience medical neglect I realize this is a communication problem I have to find a new communicative doctor is that what I'm supposed to think? See that's the problem I don't want to worry about another person and I don't care about professionals I want my medical care I wonder if I'm being denied care because I'm a woman and they think that I'm all about abortion I'm all about getting my mental health care and my anxiety and insomnia meds.\n\nWhat a joke ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇü§£ what a bunch of little hoops to jump through I wonder what it's going to prove?ngry at medical Care for rejecting me and letting me go this is not a job where you neglect and tell people no this is suffering people that are medical patients I'm a patient you are a patient.\n \nHe had patients are ignored because patients don't matter? Is that what I'm supposed to think? After I looked at all of this two days ago I made an appointment for therapy and therapy is another hoop to jump through and this is important because they owe me case management \n\nAnd that's a big mistake for me because they don't owe me anything even though I'm disabled they don't owe me anything they don't know me and I don't know them. So it's a lot of carrying everything myself and taking everything in stride and living with pain living in pain and simply enduring it all but that also means that I can't function in life so I'm more of an ineffective person without my medication so I tell people this week and this month I am ineffective and don't rely on me that's exactly what I tell everybody in my life never rely on me for anything.",

That's what life is about. Having fun, and trying to facilitate your ability to have fun. It's hard, because life isn't very conductive to fun, but it's worth trying, more than any of the empty crap people force into the brains of adults and kids.\n\n\nBut life is inherently miserable. We're born crying, from crying women who's pelvises are barely large enough to get a baby's head out. We develop through at least thirteen years of exceptional physical and mental vulnerability, during which even competitively minor events, like seeing two people fight, can severely affect you mentally. Then, as adults, we're forced to struggle and climb to the top of one of a huge number of social and economic ladders, and by the time you're at the top, or at least on a rung you can rest on until you die, you're high-strung and suffering from multiple physical problems. The lucky people who scamper to the top, or sometimes were born there, do little but shake the ladder telling you it's for your own good. The unlucky ones fall down into the muck of poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, and other assorted forms of misery. In short, life is hard. Especially for a human mind, which can comprehend how challenging these things are and reflect on them, and lament on all of the times they've failed, been fucked over, or just been unlucky. That's why religions are created promising a better life after this one. People want a better life, and telling them that they'll get one at the end, as long as they pay the fee, is very marketable. But life is miserable. That's why escaping life is paramount. Whatever you choose to escape with, as long as you're not harming anyone, do it. But also keep trying to improve your life outside of scaping it. Because the only thing you can do at the bottom of the ladder is try to keep climbing, even if people above you are throwing rocks and nails on you.¬†\n\n\nJesus, that got excessive.¬†",
