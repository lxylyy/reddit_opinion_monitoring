Society likes the *idea* of supporting mental health, but when it comes to the messy, raw reality of it—like clinical depression or more severe struggles—it gets uncomfortable for people. It’s almost like there’s a limit to the empathy they’re willing to give, and once you cross it, they don’t know how to respond.\n\nIt sucks because being vocal and honest about those darker moments is when you need support the most. But instead, you’re met with silence or awkwardness, which makes the isolation even worse. People mean well, but sometimes their own discomfort takes over, and they pull back instead of leaning in.\n\nHating everyone and yourself is such a heavy burden to carry, and I hope you’re able to give yourself grace in this moment. The fact that you’re even sharing this shows strength, even if it doesn’t feel like it. You’re not doomed—none of us are—but we do have a lot of growing to do as a society when it comes to truly being there for each other.\n\nFor now, know this: your feelings are valid, and being frustrated with people’s lack of understanding doesn’t make you wrong or broken. It just means you see the gap between where we are and where we should be. That’s a painful but powerful awareness.",

Church!\" And so on.)\n\nWe've got at least twenty (more?} people on here who get it. Out of 8 billion people on the planet... that's...um...a really small percentage.  But at least there are a few of us fellow travelers who do understand!  \n\nI have come to think it's part of the evil bitch that depression is.  Everyone of those 8 billion people knows what it feels like.  They've experienced it. Missed out on promotion.  Failed a grade in school. Lost a relative. Broken up with SO. Had terrible lingering illness. Lots of things can make us feel depressed.\n\nBut then these people make the gigantic mistake of thinking that whatever they experienced while \"depressed\" is the sum total of depression.  They are absolutely convinced that they know exactly how you feel and exactly how to fix you.\n\nThey have no effin' clue that they have experienced the tip of the iceberg only, no clue how deep and dark and massive the iceberg really is, and (usually) no desire to learn.  \n\nSo, as a fellow traveler who has spent more time under that iceberg than on the surface, screw all those \"pick yourself up by the bootstraps\" people and their unhelpful advice.\n\nJust remember or try to believe that it gets better.  I know how phony and stupid that sounds, especially when you're in the darkness. But I swear to you that it's true.  Even when the simple act of continuing to breathe and just staying alive seems impossible, remember that this reddit rando is thinking of you and pulling for you. Because it does get better. I promise.\n\nNo thanks to those superficial so-called friends offering yoga and smoothies and other such stuff--sadly, they aren't ever going to get it. So forget about them and focus on yourself and the things that help you. The things that make you happy or even just less down. And you can work your way out from that iceberg and its numbing enormity.\n\nSometimes it feels like one step forward, twenty-seven steps back. And the depression iceberg seems to block all the light, holding you immovable, trapped. But if you can hold on for one more breath, one more minute, and maybe one or two more, you can start to feel a tiny bit of movement somewhere deep inside yourself. And gradually, that bit of movement gets big enough for you to take a shower, say, or have a snack. Watch an episode of TV or read a book.  Go stand outside or even go for a walk. \n\nPlease, please remember that even in the depths of despair, when all seems lost, it isn't.  It does get better.  \n\n\n\nFull disclosure:  I do have a \"magic answer\" to depression.  For me, it's my cats.  I swear they have saved my life over the years.  Cats are awesome sauce. 😻",
