      "body": "I definitely agree that it‚Äôs best to seek help. A good counselor can be a huge asset. Another help is exercise. I‚Äôve been depressed pretty much my entire life and my most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, happiest and engaged years were when I used both counseling and exercise (a proven treatment for depression). Now I‚Äôm again at a real low point, wishing my life was over and just plain tired of it all after all these years (71). Tired of wearing my mask (don‚Äôt talk about it with anyone). It‚Äôs really gotten old (like me lol). But there are things that can help if one wants to improve how they feel. My counselor, who herself had faced her own demons, often spoke of the ‚Äúbaby steps‚Äù, putting one foot in front of the other each day and sometimes a few steps backwards. Mindfulness was also a technique that she stressed (and I used). Another technique I discovered in the last few years is EFT tapping. These things have helped in the past but I don‚Äôt seem to have the energy or care to access them now. ¬†But to all of you that post about the same struggles‚Ä¶I get it.¬†",
