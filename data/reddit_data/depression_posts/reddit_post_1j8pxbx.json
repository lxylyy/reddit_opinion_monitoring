It's hard but doable.\n\nProblem is that in that state you want an instant result but it doesn't work like that, sadly. What may help is not talking to others but getting a real body double.  Even if this person is going through depression as well. In my case it was my long distance friend who was making music (as i do) who was not just depressed but also diagnosed with schizophrenia. And was heavy alcoholic once. He quit drinking one day, got a job and managed to get better too. Inner voice VS real echo chamber are different things, so body double might work.\n\nAnother thing is mindset. Once i began focusing on what progress i did today (even if it was so little) instead of what i didn't do it began to get better. Real mind experiment, like going to gym and get to set yourself to improve every day. Having support from others helps.\n\nAll in all, it took me about 1.5 years to get out of it. I got laid off, had to relocate, been unemployed for \"only\" 2 months, had to live off of my credit card. It's 6 months since i got new job and still haven't paid my debt. But at least i'm stable now. Also i almost stopped my anxiety, which is another long story (i'm 35, by the way)\n\nI also thought that exercising won't do until i got into mundane life living from weekend to weekend. So i began ice skating with my wife and felt that even single session improved my mood. I always found running or typical gym stuff boring due to its repetitive nature. I still find it boring but now i know that it can really help so i substituted it with playing Stepmania or doing exercise bike (while playing games). But maybe i'll go for a run some day.\n\nAnd it seems that each stage of depression or anxiety needs to be treated differently. Somehow find a way to keep going and trying. It's really to begin, but once you start to recognize those \"mood swings\" it may become more manageable.",

That is what I told myself 9 months ago and it was the beginning of my new life. My life is literally bearded guy in the van down by the river and I'm am euphorically happy.

I stopped trying to make myself fit into something I didn't even understand. You are living your life according to what others say, do and want. No wonder their advice doesn't work for you. Go live that life you've always wanted but you've been too insecure to make reality. Nobody is watching, this isn't getting uploaded to social media, you're not answering nor influencing anyone. Unplug from this. No noise is scary at first then it becomes fucking tranquil. Stop grinding for a future that is getting further away from attainable. Go travel the world.

Stop stressfully clinging onto everything that's ever come into your world as if trophies justify your being and just let them naturally come and go.

It gave me really deep feel of loneliness) and, as i thought, wasted time:\n\n\\- my best friend turned out to be too into politics and too patriotic with \"look how crap other countries are\" while i was in relocation. And overall disappointment in people played the role\n\n\\- my coworkers (i work as software QA) were not open minded and curious, sometimes it was literally sabotaging my job because when i asked them questions they asked in response \"why do you need to know that?\" (to do my job, duh). Really discouraging. If not coworkers, then management didn't have any strategy, so i tried my best to be on my own. In the end i switched 6 companies since 2017. Current, 7th, is small, it's tough because i need to wear many hats. But, at least, i understand what i need to do, so i'll manage.\n\n\\- getting laid off unlocked new fear that i'll never have secure job (which is, actually, true)\n\n\\- still can't afford own apartment and renting because prices and mortgage % went up\n\n\\- low self-esteem\n\n\\- i used to make music and had other hobbies but had to put them off because of job. Actually i've been good at my hobbies and could make a decent living out of them and i've been grieving over it a lot\n\nIt doesn't look that bad, but i've constantly been stumbling upon these. I knew that i've had better life 5 years ago than now. While depressed i mostly been sleeping and went out of my apartment once in 3 weeks to take out trash and do groceries.\n\nI could say that i wasted last 5 years on dealing with people nonsense, but on the other hand i learned many \"do's\" and \"don't's\". Also anxiety motivated me to dig into all that brain stuff to understand what might go on with me. I tried vitamins, exercising, cutting off coffee, journaling to slow down thoughts. My depressed buddy was on the same page with me trying to figure things out. We constantly were discussing random topics: from what currently makes us depressed and what we can do about it to random topics about music or movies that were our fond and sweet memories. This is what made us moving. This guy's story is something else and is really wild (long story short, he disappeared last summer and i don't know what really happened. But he got better, too)\n\nAt some point i couldn't stand my team from previous job and resigned without having any offers. Got tired of getting anxious every time i clock in. It took me 2 months to get new job. This time i knew that i'm on my own and did my best to onboard and be useful. It's small company and i did work in such once, so i know how it's done. And it worked. I feel content now because when i got freedom on how to do my job and really nailed it. Nobody was micromanaging me and gaslighting with \"you're QA you only need to do X Y and Z\". It was hard, actually, but i focused on making impact every day instead of focusing on what i didn't do. Even small impact counted. It brought back my self esteem.\n\nThen i simply cut off all news, politics, social media to reduce the noise. Everybody wants to waste your time. And i cut off all people in real life who were draining my energy. I've been working on my empathy to care better about my wife. In other words i made myself my best friend as intended by nature, since i'm introverted and really autonomous person. Making music gave me valuable lesson: to create is harder than to take. But it makes others move. So i decided to go this way: upskill, learn, help people when needed.\n\nAlso understanding yourself better helps too, so you can dig into MBTI types and cognitive functions (in the end it doesn't matter but you get base to work on).

Start answering questions your mind is asking you about whatever past experiences or personality issues are causing depression (therapy/giving yourself time etc)\n2. Fix your diet and lifestyle¬†\n\n\nIts still very complicated. Everybody knows this. They can't do this because they don't have the energy & I don't blame them.¬†",

I know that when I was going through a pretty rough time, I wasn't sleeping and honestly, it was an ongoing nightmare. My appetite was out of whack too. I went to see a counsellor and his advice was to address the physiological symptoms first and foremost. \n\nI did yoga and breathing exercises and physical exercise whenever I could push myself, even if that meant running in place or walking around my apartment. Gradually my appetite returned and my sleeping improved. My depression didn't disappear but I've felt significantly better ever since. Looking back, I really believe that the lack of sleep was the worst component. \n\nAnyway, I hope you are able to find a way to address your insomnia and hopefully that helps alleviate some of the other strains you're experiencing.

I am stingy on when I take medication to help me sleep cos it doesn‚Äôt actually help so I think well if I keep taking it more and more then I am going to get a higher tolerance so 1/2 nights a week is all. When I was in hospital my psychiatrist said what he is giving me shouldn‚Äôt knock out a rhino it should knock out the whole zoo. So I just keep going with it. I‚Äôve tried it all. Sleepio app. Sleep restriction. Wind down at night. Wake up same time each morning. Etc etc. I just hope one day something works and I sleep and get rested.
