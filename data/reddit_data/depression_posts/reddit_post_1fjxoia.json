  "selftext": "24F here. My life’s a depressing toxic dump and I’m lonely as hell. Sex is my only escape from this dumpster fire. Angry? Horny.numb? Horny. Sad? Horny. Busy? Horny , tired ? Horny. or just plain fed up? My room is my happy place because nothing else gives me that feels. \nDeleted social media to ‘focus on myself lol’ but now all I do is think about sex  Feels good for a sec, then I’m just hollow. Am I broken or just craving love? This messed-up coping thing is starting to seem like my only option. \nAnd honestly im so over it lifes a mess . Lost my passion for gaming and all the fun stuff i used to do - so depressed bored and horny . Nothing really matters anymore ",

I find myself with similar degressive self gratifying cycles where you find things that make you feel good whether sex, food, drugs, tech  etc or some combination and you just start making them your reason to live.  They become the clock of your life.  Your reason to get up. But the tragic truth I've found is that in the cycles of self gratifying that feels momentarily better the worst me starts to come out.  The sense that this isn't what I'm here for becomes undeniable.  The knowledge that you could be doing something else.  The shame and embarrassment makes it better to be alone.  That sinks you deeper in.  In the end only facing the situations that put you in this this depressive cave of self loathing through the overindulgence of life's gifts will get you out.

Just throwing myself at any person who's interested in having sex with me or just spending my days touching myself for multiple times a day. I think it has to do with some sort of positive gratification that being horny and then acting on it releases. You can't just live like this. I've blown off work at times just to stay in and consume an unhealthy amount of porn and sexual content while pleasuring myself. This is just unsustainable and I'm sorry that you're having to deal with it as well. And not to forget, not having any sustainable relationships or friends in the mix to help you out and distract you. \n\nAnyway, I'm always up for aa chat and to lend an ear if you'd like.

So living alone just kinda sucks in general. On a mental and emotional level, you are lacking in hormones that are ment to stabilize and improve mood. Serotonin, endorphin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. \n\nSerotonin is produced when you feel joy, endorphin is produced to counter adrenaline during physical activity and is also produced when you feel satisfied or a sense of accomplishment, and norepinephrine is produced when you feel affection. \n\nSex and self pleasure produce endorphin and dopamine, but both quickly ware off and you just kinda feel numb unless it's with an intimate partner. Then the norepinephrine actually intensifies them and makes the last longer. The thing you need is a partner. Which, sadly, is difficult to find for no reason...\n\nMy best advice is to find places that matched your old interests and hobbies. Join some folks at a game club or lounge. You can at least make some new friends and possibly even find a relationship. Dating sites/ apps are a slim option unless you can afford to use them fully, so physical meetings might be best unless you are good at social media. \n\nYou have my full support in finding something the ease the void and make this life more bearable.
