I apologize if it feels stalkerish but I just rewatched Erykah Badu‚Äôs Window Seat music video because of you. It was so epic‚Ä¶ it took me out of mindless scrolling on reddit for 5 minutes so I appreciate you for that. \nI wish I can have courage like her to break out of my depression cycle. I know it might not mean much but it feels comforting knowing someone with similar interests as me go through difficult times. I have a feeling I may never marry or even a partner in the future. Maybe flings‚Ä¶ I hope I can find the will to live though.",
