If deep down you wish to be saved, then there is something within you that has hope and doesn't want to die. Depression is making you feel this way - that you need to end your life, but it's not the real you. It's a monster that destroys people and don't let it win. I care about you and I'd like to believe people here and people in your life do too. Please don't let depression win.",

If not, ok too.\n\nTake off walking.  Hit the road Jack.\n\nToss your ID away,  pick a new name and set off on an adventure. \n\nWhat do you have to lose? In the other scenario you are dead. It may seem scary and risky but so is the alternative.  \n\nHitch hike, meet new people, go from one town to another.  If you're on the west head east,  if youre on east then go west.\n\nThere's plenty of land to travel so don't stay too long in one place. Meet the locals, get a cash job, bartender,  server, construction,  harvest crops, fisher, boat hand, whatever. There's plenty of ways to make the cash you need to get by.\n\nYou can start without money, without anything,  just go.\n\nSee the sites. You have absolutely nothing to lose. You're dead anyways. So it doesn't matter.\n\nLive life on the fringe. Most important,  live life. I promise death will arrive for you on time when it's supposed.  Like for all of us.\n\nOk, I hope you seen this. I hope you see it as a better but equal alternative.  You still disappear from your life that you have now. The old you is dead but the new you, whoever that is, you pick, is hitting the road. \n\nWhen you hit Texas, hit me up, we'll get a drink and you can tell me how it's going. \n\nOk my friend,  that's my advice.  I pray you get moving and let a new beginning start right now.\n‚ù§Ô∏è",
