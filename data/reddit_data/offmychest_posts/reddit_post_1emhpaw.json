  "title": "Found out my husband has an affair baby while at work",
  "selftext": "Edit: I've had some great comments, you guys have buoyed me. I'm going to step back and try to get through the day. I will try and update when I have anything.\n\nObviously posting from a throwaway but I needed to rant.\n\nSo, I just found out that not only did my husband of six years fucking cheat on me but he has a child with his mistress. How, you may ask? Well, I work at the WIC office. For those who don't know what WIC is it is the Women, Infant, and Children Program. We provide nutritional education and supplemental food benefits to qualifying members. We are a government agency, operating under local, state, and Federal regulations.\n\nWe use a program called Crossroads to manage our clients.\n\nThis literally just happened this morning and I am not even remotely okay and I'm not even really processing it yet. So, this woman calls in and asks if she can sign up for WIC, she just had a baby. I say sure, start her a new family profile. I get her info, her baby's name. Part of setting up a profile is asking if the parent wants to add a second parent or guardian to the profile. She says yes, add my fiancé.\n\nShe gives me his first and last and I'm thinking, hey that's my husband's name but he has a kind of normal, generic name. I have to have his birthday, she gives it to me. Its my husband's birthday. I'm thinking, coincidences happen. We have a Telehealth system so I tell her we need a photo of her ID and her fiancé's ID to complete the verification process, which isn't a total lie, we'd need hers the day of her and the baby's certification appointment. She says she'll send hers first and get the fiancé to send his and she'd forward it to me.\n\nIt took half an hour for her to forward a photo of his ID. I tried to remain calm. It wouldn't be him, right? Right?\n\nFucking, goddamn wrong.\n\nIt was him. It was his Driver's License with the photo him in the fucking Tommy Bahama shirt I bought him for his birthday. My fucking husband of six years. I've only worked for this county's WIC for a month after transferring in from another county and he's been having trouble remembering I switched offices but you seriously hear that your side-piece is talking to an office that is the same thing your wife does and you don't stop and think rationally for a moment?\n\nI can't even breathe.\n\nThe baby is two weeks old. He's been out of town for three weeks on business but I'll be my whole salary he's been with her before, during, and after the birth. Bonding with their child. We've been trying for three years to have a baby. I've had half a year's worth of miscarriages. We have a healthy sex life. We don't even close the door when we use the bathroom anymore. That's how married we are. He has wiped my ass for me when I fractured my neck and couldn't twist far enough. I've shaved his back.\n\nAnyway, I get off work at 5pm and I don't know what I'm going to do. My coworkers and my director know something is wrong but I just can't tell anyone yet. I'm humiliated. Our anniversary was last month, I posted this big, mushy thing on FB. I feel like a damn fool. I wonder if his friends know, or his mom. Am I the only one who doesn't know?\n\nThis is the only place I can just vent. I don't know what to do. I'm not even heartbroken, I'm just numb.\n\nEdit: I bet that asshole I'm married to did this on purpose. How can a person make it 32 years and do something so monumentally stupid? Or his side-piece knew I work her and did it on purpose. There's no fucking way this just happened. This was done to me on purpose.",

They just want to divide up your assets and debts. There won’t be a dramatic reckoning in court. I mention this because people suggested going to her place to take pictures. No need to, and it risks you losing it before you are ready. You know it happened, and he knows it happened. \n\nTalk to an attorney today. There are some tricky rules in states about car insurance, health insurance, property division, etc. \n\nAsk your attorney about taking half of the joint marital funds right before you file. Whether money he spent on his new family can be held against him in property division, if he added his baby to his health insurance, can you recoup any of the extra premium he’s been paying.

Do you think your miscarriages were a caused by this,  because you said she just gave birth and in a year you had several of them.

He tried throwing you into the lion’s den and you will show him who is the lioness. The goal is to stay fully calm and stealth, give him no chance to try to save his ass. A little revenge plan like the flowers could be sent only  after you lawyer up and hire a PI sooner the better. If your state is at fault, his lies will catch up to him and you could also sue them for alienation of affection. Even if you are in a no fault state, if you find out if he used marital funds to support his mistress you could get a better divorce settlement.\n\nGod saved you from this man and you will find one day that you will be healed and with that will come your own little family, good man and your ex will be just a fleeting thought to laugh on.

We have a Telehealth system so I tell her we need a photo of her ID and her fiancé's ID to complete the verification process, which isn't a total lie, we'd need hers the day of her and the baby's certification appointment. She says she'll send hers first and get the fiancé to send his and she'd forward it to me.\n\n> It took half an hour for her to forward a photo of his ID. I tried to remain calm. It wouldn't be him, right? Right?\n\n> Fucking, goddamn wrong.\n\n> It was him. It was his Driver's License with the photo him in the fucking Tommy Bahama shirt I bought him for his birthday. My fucking husband of six years. I've only worked for this county's WIC for a month after transferring in from another county and he's been having trouble remembering I switched offices but you seriously hear that your side-piece is talking to an office that is the same thing your wife does and you don't stop and think rationally for a moment?\n\nYou may have exposed yourself to a lawsuit or employment action with this action. \n\nI would delete this post, and advise you to retain counsel and disclose this to them. Good luck and sorry about the husband.",

In regards to pregnancy and I hope this is okay to say.  \nI know you had some pregnancies that ended up in miscarriages which would be painful and traumatising.   I struggled with infertility for over 12 years before being able to have children. But after all the stuff with your soon to be ex is over.  Please see a doctor to see why you were having the miscarriages.  It could be because of progesterone issues and simply need to take progesterone or other issues like endo or something else.  Look also and check to make sure you do not have MTHFR. I found out I did.  You need a specialised doctor to investigate for you.  If you want children in the future I would advise freezing your eggs and keeping them in storage. (Do quite a few egg collections).  This way you have more than one egg collection.  I started at 30 but took years in my late 30s before starting ivf and wish I had done ivf to collect my eggs when I was way younger).  I just want to give this advise to you so you have no regrets going forward whatever you decide in life. \n\nBest of wishes OP.  I wish you the best. Big hugs.",

People will always do what people do, Remember that when this is all said and done, you get to be the amazing you and he's stuck being the POS he clearly is. I say this with extreme clarity as I caught my own wife cheating on me with 4 or 5 dudes on the internet (pictures, video, who tf knows what else) and she lost someone who would have laid down on the highway for her. I was the person that covered all the bills, contributed money for her to play in the markets, appease her desire for anything she really wanted, and more than anything - took care of her in her cycles of depression and manic phases. \n\nThis all occurred in the last 6 months. I have zero contact with her but she DID sell everything of value that I own in a 50/50 state in the middle of divorce proceedings to the tune of about 22k, much of it pre-marital. She's broke, probably running an OF account, relapsed on her benzo addiction, and spent all of the student loan money she pulled to achieve her MBA. Literally spiraled back to the person she was when I met her. \n\nI was initially incredibly upset, well, worse than that - I felt worthless and almost gave up on life altogether but ultimately realized that again - people will do what people do regardless of the consequences, perceived and not. She's going to owe me an enormous amount of money for quite some time and when she doesn't pay she will go to jail for violation of a court decree. I hold no ill will toward her and wish her all the good health and prosperity in the world but I do value justice and the law and refuse to grant an ounce of clemency in this matter. Wrong is wrong. The cheating was bad enough but one of the things she sold was a custom gaming PC that also held about 22tb of personal data, my entire life before and during out 7 year relationship and I don't think she knew to at least wipe the drives. \n\nShe's been ostracized by her entire family, completely cut off for the behavior, has zero support from any of them while I still have lunches and dinners with my MIL and other family members. Strangely, I've found complete peace regarding the situation and feel a great deal of pity for her, albeit without a single shred of forgiveness in the eyes of the law. My family has gotten calls from Sallie May looking for her as well as I and I simply told them that the loan money was spent on Amazon; random nonsense that she/we didn't need before I discovered the duplicity. \n\nThe reason I ask you to find it in yourself to simply forgive is to eliminate the negative energy and feelings you're going to feel, free yourself from those feelings and bonds and remember to live your best life and you are winning, despite possibly feeling like you've lost. You no longer have to be deceived by someone you thought loved you as much as you likely loved them. You're free from this person who's clearly a complete POS and never had your best interests in mind, much less a shred of dignity or truthfulness. \n\nThat said - as others have mentioned, scorched earth is in order. One can forgive another while exacting the comeuppance this man deserves. I reserve a special place in my heart for people who don't have the ability or inclination of honesty in a committed relationship. \n\nIn my own pettiness I purchased every URL of her name and as soon as the divorce is final all 10 websites go live with the truth of who she truly is; a predator without the ability to feel true guilt, remorse, and lives her life as a professional and perpetual victim. I've researched the laws regarding this and what I'm doing is completely legal. I did it out of pity and warning for her next victim so they might possibly be able to avoid the same fate I did. \n\nLastly, remember to take care of yourself. Remember that this isn't your fault, you deserve better, and do your best to not let it salt your future relationships. I understand the feelings what you're likely feeling very very well and have had 6 months to process this. Lawyer up, get your due, and move tf on, there's someone out there for you that *will treat you right.*",

The wife knew what was up and she wanted to keep her husband and his mistresses busy so her parents could move all his shit out of their house and change the locks. \n\nShe sent her husband out on some ridiculous errand the morning of her discharge and had her parents pick her and the baby up. Because she knew where her husband would be, she had him served publicly at the hospital with the divorce papers when he returned from getting her food or whatever. \n\nHe was fired.

Hopefully they will keep you on the right track legally and also help support you.\n\nAnd you must talk to a lawyer. You may not even be able to tell your friends or family how you have found this out. I don’t know exactly (which is why I really hope you have a good colleague or boss that you can reach out to) but double check every move you want make before you make it. Do not compromise yourself because of this vile man and what he has done to you. You are better than that.\n\nPrepare! Prepare! Prepare! Get every piece of evidence you can together while he is away. Remove everything that is dear to you or instrumental to your life (documents etc) from that house now. Make it as close as possible to the point that you could walk out and never need to go back. Even if it all looks normal on the surface.\n\nOnly you can make the choice of what you do when he comes back. You know he did it so is there any reason to confront him and ask? That completely depends on what you want. You need to think about that for the next few days? Is there anything that he can possibly say that you want to hear? Or do you want to see him squirm? Only you can choose. If there is nothing then just make sure all your belongings are safe and either go and leave a note telling him to only contact you through your lawyer or change the locks if you want him to go. If you want to see him admit it then plan ahead so you can walk at any point still. Keep in mind that this decision may change a number of times in the coming days. You may feel too emotionally exhausted to deal with it and know that the confusion and realisation of coming back and finding you gone will completely derail him (maybe setting up cameras so you can watch his arrival home would be therapeutic!). Or, maybe you want that front row ticket in person and the rage will fuel you through. Like I say, only you know that. Decide what is going to be best for you, you owe him nothing. Whatever you choose should only be for your own benefit. But remember that house is about to be a battle ground so no matter if you want to walk out or if you want him out it is still better to remove anything of importance to you either way. Then you have the choice.\n\nI hope so much that he is devastated by this. I hope his world comes crashing down around him. I hope that he receives back the pain he has given out a hundred fold. I also hope that you find some peace in whatever happens. I hope you heal. I hope you find someone worthy of you when (if?) you are ready. Do not compromise yourself though. Hold that strength and integrity and resilience and make sure you walk out of this with your head held high. I am so sorry for the pain you must be feeling right now.",
