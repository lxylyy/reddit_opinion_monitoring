Do you know how underwhelming a flaccid D is? üòñ Cialis and Viagra no longer worked so he had to give himself two injections into his D. üò± Then it‚Äôs was hard for an hour or more which made me sore af‚Ä¶and bored eventually. We‚Äôre both senior citizens btw.\n\nOne day, after a supremely shitty day at work, I come home to an unexpected surprise üòÆof a rock hard ‚ú®üçÜ‚ú®& him grinning.  I was close to tears as it was & the dam just broke.  All I could do was cry and scream, ‚ÄúNOW??? NOW??? If you‚Äôd have just called or texted me, I‚Äôd have told you how HORRIBLE my day was going and to please open a bottle of wine.‚Äù  Those shots are expensive af but it was the LAST thing on my mind. üòñü•Ä\n\nWell, I ended up breaking up with him during the honeymoon because he tried erotic asphyxiation without prior clearance and knowing I was a üçá survivor and it triggered something in me.  I could no longer get aroused no matter what he did. \n\nSo it was definitely for the best. üòí I‚Äôm mostly 4B now. There‚Äôs a few ex‚Äôs that were talented, gentle, gifted and skilled that I would consider - but for now the miracle of a good wank suffices. üòõüåπ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

Go to a specialist if you have to. No, the blue pills don‚Äôt give you erections or fix the problem. That‚Äôs not how they work. You have to work at it too. Erections don‚Äôt go away because you are old. Happens to younger guys too. Diet, exercise, belly fat, stress, trauma, alcohol, smoking, low T, hormones, prostate, heart‚Ä¶can all be bringing you down. Blue pill won‚Äôt fix those. One previous reply to this thread says pituitary. Goes for women too. If you are young, get some baseline blood tests to know your specific conditions so you can stay on path, or at least know how far you may have deviated and where you want to maintain. Go.

If she is not okay with any of the above, that's also fine, and he needs to respect that. His disrespect of that is not fine.\n\nCommunication, consent, boundaries, and respect are the most important things here and should be the basis of any sexual relationship.\n\nThe only thing you bring to the table is your sense of entitlement over women's bodies, which is funny because you are prejudiced towards sex workers. If you believe men have \"urges\" they need to relieve, some sex workers are brilliant for that. Make it make sense. There's a contradiction between you clearly believing men are entitled to women's bodies to relieve their \"natural\" \"urges,\" but as soon as a woman consensually profits off sex work or even if she has had sex with lots of other people, you look down on her. You clearly don't view men in the same light, despite suggesting men will find other women to have sexual relationships with if they don't relieve their partner's \"urges.\"\n\nYou're a misogynist. Plain and simple.\nAlso, quit blaming everyone else for your relationship status. Your misogyny plays a huge role in you being single. Do some inner work and learn to respect women.",
