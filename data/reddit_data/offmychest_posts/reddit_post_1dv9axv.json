You guessed it. \n\nI give this man a few loving forehead kisses and ruffle his hair after a long day, and he’s dragging me to the bedroom. I’m not saying he walks around with a hard on 24/7, but I seriously underestimate how much it takes to set him off. We’ve been married for half a year now but I’m still not used to it.",

Go to a specialist if you have to. No, the blue pills don’t give you erections or fix the problem. That’s not how they work. You have to work at it too. Erections don’t go away because you are old. Happens to younger guys too. Diet, exercise, belly fat, stress, trauma, alcohol, smoking, low T, hormones, prostate, heart…can all be bringing you down. Blue pill won’t fix those. One previous reply to this thread says pituitary. Goes for women too. If you are young, get some baseline blood tests to know your specific conditions so you can stay on path, or at least know how far you may have deviated and where you want to maintain. Go.

In this case, that would look like respecting each others' consent and boundaries.\n\nIf she is okay with him using pics or videos he already has of her, if she is okay with taking new pics or videos or if she is okay with him watching porn, then that's fine. If she is not okay with any of the above, that's also fine, and he needs to respect that. His disrespect of that is not fine.\n\nCommunication, consent, boundaries, and respect are the most important things here and should be the basis of any sexual relationship.\n\nThe only thing you bring to the table is your sense of entitlement over women's bodies, which is funny because you are prejudiced towards sex workers. If you believe men have \"urges\" they need to relieve, some sex workers are brilliant for that. Make it make sense. There's a contradiction between you clearly believing men are entitled to women's bodies to relieve their \"natural\" \"urges,\" but as soon as a woman consensually profits off sex work or even if she has had sex with lots of other people, you look down on her. You clearly don't view men in the same light, despite suggesting men will find other women to have sexual relationships with if they don't relieve their partner's \"urges.\"\n\nYou're a misogynist. Plain and simple.\nAlso, quit blaming everyone else for your relationship status. Your misogyny plays a huge role in you being single. Do some inner work and learn to respect women.",
