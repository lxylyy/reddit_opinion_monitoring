  "selftext": "I went to a deli¬†around midnight last night¬†for food. I see this really young girl (she‚Äôs maybe 21 or 22) who is incredibly intoxicated. She can‚Äôt even stand up. I look over and I see this creepy delivery guy, who is in his late 50s or 60s, literally telling her ‚Äúlet me take you somewhere to feel better.‚Äù He keeps trying to give her something she does not want. I‚Äôm too far away to see what it is. Moments later, he sits her down in a chair and is clearly trying to coax her into leaving with him. I call the police and they claim they‚Äôll be there soon. 10 minutes pass and no one arrives.\n\nI go outside, and all of a sudden, I see this guy HOLDING HER UP and dragging her through the streets of New York. He is aggressively making out with her and she has no idea where she is.\n\nI called the police again to no avail. I follow them and finally, the guy gets to his apartment and I had to intervene. I asked him if he knows this girl. He gets startled and backs away. She grabs me for a drunk hug. The guy panics and says he is the police, then changes his story to that‚Äôs his sister. He reaches in his pocket to make it seem like he had a badge or gun. I completely ignore it because adrenaline had taken over at this point. I wasn't going to let this POS intimidate me. I asked the girl if she knew this dude or if she knew where she was, and she says no, they were going to have a ‚Äúfun time.‚Äù I then asked her if she wanted that and she told me no, she just wanted to go home. I snatched the girl‚Äôs stuff from his hands and we walk away. The loser pulls out his phone to record us. I suspect he was going to flip and say I was the one harming her.\n\nWe go into a bodega down the street to kill time. She is a mess ‚Äî crying and saying she wants to call her dog to pick her up. The bodega owner steps in to keep her calm. That‚Äôs how drunk she was. A small crowd gathers inside the store because no one knows what‚Äôs going on. Luckily, a bystander intervened because he saw the fucking loser STILL lurking outside waiting for her to leave. This idiot finally comes in the store and acts as if he knows her. The police show up (after 20 - 30 minutes) and questions him. He can‚Äôt keep track of his lies, so they kick him out and warn him to stay away from her. The police eventually orders her an Uber from her phone to send her home.\n\nI am a little shaken up by it. I know it‚Äôs 2025, but I cannot believe this guy was going to sexually assault this girl if I had not intervened. The one thing that still bothers me were the cops telling me afterwards that it was no big deal because people get drunk all the time in the city. Yet they thanked me anyway. No, this was going to be rape. Blatant rape.\n\nI feel like I fucked up because this guy has footage of me and I don‚Äôt have footage of him. I don‚Äôt know. I guess I‚Äôm venting at this point. I feel like this should not be traumatic for me in any way, but I‚Äôve been thinking about it ever since. So fucked up, man.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. It truly means a lot.",

The police did not seem to care or take her seriously, as well as taking so long to respond that if you hadn't interviened that girl would not have gotten the help she needed.\n\nOr even if she hadn't gotten assaulted, the police might've thrown her in the drunk tank like they did to me when I was roofied. My university was a big party school with a significant rape culture, so most of us girls at that school were roofied and/or assaulted at least one or two time when we were undergrads ages 17-22. That was 12 years ago but I can't imagine that it would be much different now. This issue is so widespread I don't know if I know any women who have not experienced sexual assault. \n\nI don't know how aware of the scope of this issue that most men are, but it's definitely good for men to know this. And for men to understand what the effects of roofies look like & to always keep their hands covering their drinks and never let their drinks out of their sight for a second because men can be victimized too, and because men and boys in undergrad might not be aware that they might need to be careful too because they can be victims too.",

As important and understandable as it is to feel and process the negative emotions stemming from this event, you should absolutely take the time to intentionally let yourself feel the positive emotions from it as well.",

If it‚Äôs a scenario like this with a drunk woman on the street, pull out your phone, yell at the top or your lungs that the police are on their way and your live streaming this right now. Name your location, time of day and describe the rapist. \n\nUnfortunately most cases of SA happen behind closed doors and perpetuated by someone the victim knows that has some kind of power over them (such as family member, husband, teacher, coach, pastor‚Ä¶etc). This can be harder to identify, but there are signs and if you‚Äôre close with the person that you suspect something is going on, always check in with them in a safe environment away from the suspected rapist.\n\nThat‚Äôs my two cents, I get that many people wouldn‚Äôt want to put their own safety on the line, but I really believe rapists are just cowards at heart and are little threat to able bodied and minded people who take the time to confront them.",

I had bar tenders telling me they knew other bar tenders drugging people on top of numerous disgusting people like this. They also said things like this happen almost every night in most busy bars. Unfortunately, cops will give a girl a DUI for being under the influence even though she blows below the legal limit due to her mental and physical abilities being compromised. They assume it‚Äôs Special K, MDMA or Molly, etc. IF ANYONE SEES A GIRL BEING DRAGGED OR LEANING ON SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY CANT WALK ON THEIR OWN THEY HAVE PROBABLY BEEN DRUGGED. Call the police!!!!  I would say 90% are drugged and 10% are actually drunk. The deviant will put something in your drink, even if you are with friends. You just have to turn your head to speak to someone and a half a second later your drink has been sabotaged. They wait until you feel sick, dizzy, or just out of it. They‚Äôll grab them when they go to the restroom by themselves. They need to go to a hospital to have a blood test. Unfortunately, cops put them in jail and it‚Äôs too late to be tested for a date rape drug by the time they are out. If you are a cop, it should be standard procedure to have their blood tested.

She also had no ID or phone.\n\nWithout any other options, and spending about an hour trying to help her get home myself, I ended up driving to the police station, parking under their big CCTV camera, and called the police and ask them to come out to help her get home. Took them what felt like a long time, and I kept the doors locked so she wouldn't walk out and get herself hurt somewhere in her severely compromised state. \n\nEventually, when they did show up, I explained the situation, told them I was waving the fare, and that I just wanted her to be home safe.\n\nI sometimes wonder what happened after that, but I know that it was certainly better than leaving her on the side of the road, or leaving her where she was (in front of a bar downtown).\n\nI also learned a valuable lesson that women and Good Samaritans should know: Don't order an Uber/Taxi if you're that intoxicated or see someone that intoxicated. There are some bad apples out there in the business, and on top of that, the woman could end up being charged for transportation fraud if they're unable to pay. It also puts the taxi driver into a very uncomfortable situation. It's far better to call 911, and let them figure out the best way to get them home safely, or to a hospital, depending on their health at the time. I'm sure a police officer would rather drive someone home safely than to be investigating a sexual assault or, heaven forbid, a homicide.\n\nGranted, with the police in your city, the old creepy guy aside, if she were alone and in that condition, it may be better to just call for an ambulance and say you suspect alcohol poisoning. As mandatory reporters, the medics and/or the hospital will get the police involved if necessary (assuming I'm not incorrect on the mandatory reporting bit).\n\nAlso, if you do call a cab for a woman, request a female driver. At least that way the chance of it being a creep is significantly lower. At least with my company, dispatchers could specifically code calls for female drivers. I don't know if Uber or other rideshare programs do that, but local taxi companies *should* if you call in. I know that any company with TaxiLinq can code calls, and I'm sure other kinds of Taxi software can do the same.",
