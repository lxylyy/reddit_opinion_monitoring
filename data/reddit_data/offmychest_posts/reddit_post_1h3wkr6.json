But I just gotta get it off my chest how happy i was to be proven right.\n\nSo I went to the ER because I had a fever I couldn't get down and felt like I couldn't breathe. When I approached the counter and explained what was going on two nurses who were sitting behind her snickered and laughed. One said to the other in a low voice \"She could at least try harder\" and the nurse at the counter rolled her eyes, smiled and said \"Okay sweetie well you can breathe okay\" I'm not really sure why they responded that way. Maybe I looked like someone else? But it took them 2 hours to check my temp and blood pressure and when I approached they gave me attitude. Only to find out I had a temperature of 104, low blood pressure, a heart rate of 148, and my oxygen level was at 85. The lady said \"Did you drive yourself here? You must be having a hard time breathing.\" I looked at her and said \"Crazy right? It's almost like it's almost like it's why I came here\" \n\nI'll be honest I did get a satisfaction of seeing their response! I got admitted shortly after and was hospitalised for a bit. But man I got so happy seeing the fear in their eyes!",

Turned out to be a kidney stone that had me popping vicodine for 2 weeks.they wanted me to pay 3 grand for that to add insult to insult and injury.\n\nIn New Zealand I got myself into the hospital feeling out of body and weird with strange fevers. It wasn‚Äôt there when I arrived, and they told me to go home. As I was walking out the door it hit me and I kinda wobbled and asked for help. 104 fever out of no where and really wild bp/hr. Ended up in intensive care after my heart tried to give out. Turns out I had developed sepsis and was going into shock. A nice left over from a surgery the week before to remove‚Ä¶ you guessed it, a giant kidneystone. It was bad enough they put me on a little emergency plane to another hospital. \n\nMoral of the story: don‚Äôt trust your kidneys and endure \n\nSweden might have been the strangest though. I had surgery on my throat to remove a hpt tumor (that was causing my kidneystones‚Ä¶. ) and the site split open and I started bleeding everywhere. I lived right by the hospital so i clamped a hand over it and booked it over there on foot, scared a few pedestrians to boot. I get to emergency reception covered in blood trying to hold this shit closed and the woman says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt handle that here, you need to go over there‚Äù ‚Ä¶ a 15m walk away. \n\nIf I had any sense I would have told her to call me an ambulance but I walked.

This bogs down the ER and makes things difficult when it's not a true emergency.\n\nThe opioid crisis made it so ANYBODY going to the ER in pain is looked at as drug seeking. I had a finger infection that I had gone to my doctor's office. After taking my vitals they called for an ambulance. I laid in a gurney for 2.5 hours in so much pain, it was like a truck was parked on my finger. The gurney was saturated in sweat and they finally gave me a nerve block. Within seconds I sank into the mattress as my body relaxed. My very first thought was why the F did they make me wait 2.5 hours just for a nerve block. 2 years ago I almost cut my index finger off. It was barely attached. They gave me 1/2 mg of morphine, wrapped it up and made an appt with an Orthopedist for the next day. They told me to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. After the orthopedist did surgery, that left me with pins sticking out of my finger, he prescribed 3 of the  lowest dose oxy pills. The only thing that got me thru that was I had some 5 year old oxys pills I had saved. Took them for a few days then switched to max dose ibuprofen/acetaminophen. Recent L3 compression fracture in my spine, ibuprofen/acetaminophen again. At those pain levels, it just takes the edge off.\n\nNow in some states, some women have to nearly die before getting what used to be common emergency surgery.

I got treated, they gave me meds and the front desk lady and nurse told me they hope I feel better and something along the lines of how they didn‚Äôt know how bad I was feeling when compared to my charts cause I didn‚Äôt seem to making a fuss about it.\n\nidk I totally get that some people ‚Äúact ill‚Äù to get drugs or due to mental health issues but why would I want to spend my Saturday at a clinic near really sick people and also I didn‚Äôt have insurance so I‚Äôm also paying out of pocket as a broke 19 year old like miss ma‚Äôam get with the program. \n\nalso yes I do have some damage to my right ear from that due to how bad it was. It‚Äôs also super sensitive and my hearing is affected in that ear.",

I have seen patients throw themselves on the floor due to ‚Äúseizures‚Äù curse me out because I don‚Äôt push them to the front of the queue, moms and dads in hysteria screaming and borderline physically assaultive because their child who is jumping up and down while singing along with the large TV ‚Äúcan‚Äôt breathe‚Äù.   I have seen them leave the wait room, call 911 only to be ambulanced right back and have to start the wait all over.  I have seen them scream that they don‚Äôt care that the obviously gravely ill oncology child patient who is dying, ‚ÄúI was here first‚Äù.\n\nWhen I am rude or short with them, it‚Äôs because I am solely responsible for everyone in that waiting room, I have upwards of 50+ patients in the waiting room all of which are in various stages of ‚Äúsick‚Äù and getting ‚Äúsicker‚Äù while they wait. I have to rely on judgement, experience, and ‚Äúwhat they look like‚Äù because it is not an exact science (we aren‚Äôt making burgers or fitting legos), our rooms are full, and the only patient getting back there right now is the one that comes in actively dying.  It is a tremendously difficult job, I am not holding rooms empty while we laugh at the sick people. \n\nWhen a nurse discharges a patient, someone has literally cleaned their room and roomed a new one before that nurse has had a chance so sit down, drink something, use the rest room, clear their head, chart, or take care of all their other patients. It is a shitty healthcare system and unfortunately we are on the patient facing side and have to tolerate abuse all while taking care of you.\n\nYou and nobody else deserves to have their pain and suffering mocked, but when you get 100 bullshit complaints vs  1 real one that presents ambiguously, it is very difficult to identify. The issue is compounded when someone has been up there focusing on that for upwards of 8-10 hours and our brains and thought processes also start to wain, we are not robots.\n\nAgain, what they did was wrong and I am sorry it happened to you, but we are not in the hospitality industry, we are in the life saving industry.  This is not McDonald‚Äôs, it‚Äôs not the holiday inn, if I have a second and am not overwhelmed at the moment I will smile and give you extra attention if required, but if there are 100 ppl in the waiting room, 3hour waits for triage and 8hr waits for rooming with a line forming out the door, it is not humanly possible to provide ‚Äúexcellent customer service. \n\nBlame your politicians, blame the American healthcare systems, blame corporate greed, they created this environment.

Be honest, they need to know. \n\nMy dad had broken his heel years ago; when they were running tests to clear him for surgery they found he had three very blocked arteries and instead had to have open heart surgery and triple bypass. They put a yellow wristband (which signifies to the nurses that he was non-weight baring). Following surgery my father was not feeling well and said he needed to go to the bathroom. His RN said all my patients have to get up to use the facilities. She made my dad stand, he got dizzy and his bowels just released. They were tarry and she just got annoyed with the mess. They were upset with his complaints of pain. One nurse did report that the stools looked suspicious and he was taken for imaging where they determined he had a bleeding ulcer. They further discovered that his sternum (which had been cut to perform surgery and resown) had become undone. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôd used wires or a plate and screws, but whatever it was, it didn‚Äôt take and his sternum was now separated. My dad had to be rushed to surgery to address the ulcer and the sternum. My sister and I were furious and we were not about to wait for any questionnaire. We complained and we were pissed about that nurse - how did she not know the significance of the wristband; how dare they not take his pain seriously? She was taken off his section of the cardiac care unit and for the remainder of his stay there we didn‚Äôt see her. My dad didn‚Äôt speak English and my sister and I didn‚Äôt leave him alone for very long. Since this had happened during the summer and my sister was a school teacher, she was able to stay with him daily. I would go to work in NYC and then travel to the Jersey Shore a couple of days a week and stay the weekend to spend the whole day with him. The nurses assured us that we could go home to sleep but we were there early the next morning. When he did get his questionnaire following his discharge, I let them know that for all their posters about diversity, the hospital was absolutely nowhere near diverse enough and that some of their nurses needed better training on bedside manners. His doctors and surgeons (he required a plastic surgeon for the second chest closing).\n\nI understand that they come across difficult patients, but you‚Äôre dealing with people who are in a very vulnerable situation and deserve some kindness and respect.",
