  "selftext": "I wanted to tell this because it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been sitting warm in my chest for a long time.\n\nI‚Äôm 44 now, and my husband is 48. We‚Äôve been married for 20 years. It was an arranged marriage.\n\nI was 24 when we married. A PsyD student, used to reading people and helping them find their center. He was 28, already running his own company, known for being put-together, polite, and respectful. He looked perfect on paper. Almost *too* perfect. Our first few weeks were quiet, formal. Not cold, but not warm either. He was always kind, but reserved, like someone holding their breath.\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect love. But I did hope for something real.\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nIt started with small things. The way he lingered a second longer when I touched his arm. The way he paused before going to bed, like he was waiting for permission to stay close. One night, he had a nightmare and muttered my name in his sleep. I held him. He didn't pull away. He curled into me.\n\nThat was the beginning.\n\nOver time, I saw him soften. Beneath all that polish and control, there was this deeply vulnerable, gentle side of him. A part that craved affection. That needed to be held. That just‚Ä¶ wanted to be loved without being strong all the time.\n\nIt was like watching someone exhale for the first time in years.\n\nAnd I loved him more with every exhale.\n\nI became the person who traced his face when he was tired. Who kissed his temples when the world was too loud. Who held him like a child when he came home exhausted and wordless. And in return, he gave me the most sacred kind of trust, the kind where he let me see him completely.\n\nFast forward two decades and we‚Äôre still like that.\n\nHe still lays his head in my lap when he‚Äôs overwhelmed. Still clings to me at night when it rains. Still calls me ‚Äúhis soft place.‚Äù And I still hold him, always.\n\nWe raised a daughter together, and now that she‚Äôs gone to college, it‚Äôs just us again. But it feels full. Quiet, yes, but full.\n\nThe love we have isn‚Äôt loud or dramatic. It‚Äôs tender. It‚Äôs made of tiny moments. Notes left on the fridge. Late-night forehead kisses. The sound of his voice calling ‚ÄúBaby?‚Äù from the other room just to see where I am.\n\nHe was once scared he‚Äôd need me too much.\n\nNow, he knows that needing someone can be the purest form of love.\n\nAnd me?  \nI‚Äôm still holding that little boy inside him.  \nAnd I always will.",

I see how mom comforts my dad when he cries about the sad things that have happened in his life, such as the unexpected death of his father.\n\nI hope I find a husband like my father. He is an example to his daughters of a true man. Every child deserves a father they can look up to. And every child deserves parents who model what healthy marriages and true love looks like.\n\nNeeding someone isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness. It‚Äôs a sign that you are human, and that you need a person so you can go through the trials and tribulations of life together while leaning on each other.\n\nThe moment when you stop needing that person and become indifferent to their existence is the moment when love dies.",
