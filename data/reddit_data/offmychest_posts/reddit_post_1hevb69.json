  "selftext": "I overheard my husband talking to my 12 year old son and I had to share the cuteness. \n\nSon: Dad what‚Äôs cameltoe?\n\nHusband: excuse me?\n\nSon: [Friend] at school talked about it and I haven‚Äôt heard of it. \n\nH: Well, sometimes depending on what a woman is wearing, you can see shapes and lines through her clothing, between her legs. \n\nS: Oh. Weird. \n\nH: Not weird, just natural, with some leggings or swimsuits or whatever. \n\nS: Is it ok to look?\n\nH: It‚Äôs ok to glance but never stare and never make a woman uncomfortable. \n\nS: Do you notice if ladies have cameltoe?\n\nH: Sure, sometimes. \n\nS: do you look?\n\nH: Of course I notice sometimes but it‚Äôs just their body, who they are. When you‚Äôre a man you will learn you can notice things and see they are pretty without being a weirdo about it. \n\nS: Have you even noticed mom that way?\n\nH: Sure. \n\nS: Her friends?\n\nH: Sure, it happens. They‚Äôre women, it‚Äôs natural. \n\nS: What about boobs? Ok to look?\n\nH: Same answer. It can be part of a woman‚Äôs appearance, it‚Äôs fine to glance respectfully. \n\nS: You notice mom and her friends‚Äô boobs?\n\nH: Yes, sure. Have you finished your homework?\n\nI was laughing the whole time and yes I was eavesdropping. But I was so proud, of both of them!\n\n\n\n\n",

No fancy equipment seems fancy when people keep stubbing their toe in a wall too close. From 2d design you go into 3d to see how the space works. You add colours and lights and make sure that socket and switches placement is logical and flows naturally through the space. That's the base. Then you make sure that all the decorations you use stay within the budget. Et voila - that's rule of thumb for designing any space, and if you have more questions go ahead and google designer bdsm spaces worldwide :)",
