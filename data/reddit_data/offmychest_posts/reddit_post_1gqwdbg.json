I just have to wait. \n\nToday a package came to our house under her name , home alone ,I opened it .\nA long distance female sex toy they could use together over Bluetooth.\nMy boyfriend and I are both male and do not have the anatomy to use this toy .\nI packed it up like I had never opened it and didn't say anything about it .\n\nWhen he got home he said it was a phone accessory for her boyfriend as a gift , she sent it here so he wouldn't see it.\nThe small customs sticker on the box says \" personal toy.\" He ripped it off when he thought I wasn't looking .\nHe'd go to her house to drop it off the next time her boyfriend wasn't home. \n\nI am checked out of this relationship, I have little savings but I'm bleeding everything dry to save for a new place to just up and leave. \n\nI'm done . I just have to wait a little longer...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
