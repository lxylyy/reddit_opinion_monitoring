  "title": "My Stepdad Lied About Me Being Pregnant to ‚ÄúTeach Me a Lesson,‚Äù and It Traumatized Me",
  "selftext": "When I was 15, my stepdad decided to ‚Äúteach me a lesson‚Äù about responsibility in the most cruel and manipulative way imaginable. He lied and told me I was pregnant. It has come out that i had had premarital sex. He made me pee in a cup and claimed he ‚Äútested‚Äù it. I didn‚Äôt see what he did, but he came back and said I was pregnant. I had no reason to doubt him.\n\nFor roughly five months, 18 weeks, I believed I was going to have a baby. My body even seemed to respond‚ÄîI gained weight, had morning sickness, cravings, and even felt what I thought were kicks. I mentally prepared for this child. I grieved the life I thought I‚Äôd lose as a teen mom but also grew to love the baby I thought was growing inside me. My reputation at school took the expected hit. And then the hit you'd expect when i don't end up having that baby. Yep, i became that girl.\n\nWhen I finally asked about getting prenatal care, he laughed and told me he‚Äôd lied the entire time. It was at the dinner table and I'll never forget my mental state shattering. I was devastated among many other things. To make things worse, he found the pregnancy journal I had been writing in every week for the baby to one day read. He confiscated it and quoted it back to me laughing at my thoughts and feelings for weeks afterward.\n\nIt felt like I had lost a child, even though there was never a baby. It always felt wrong to say i suffered a miscarriage so i never felt like i could talk to somebody about the kind of grief i felt.\n\nThis experience has haunted me for years. It‚Äôs left me with trust issues, trauma, and a lingering grief that‚Äôs hard to explain to anyone who hasn‚Äôt been through something similar. I‚Äôve tried to find others who‚Äôve had an experience like mine, but I haven‚Äôt found anything.\n\nI wanted to share my story here because I feel like this kind of thing hasn't been talked about. If you‚Äôve been through something similar, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. And if not, thank you for letting me get this off my chest. \n\nETA - The first time i ended up actually pregnant, they ended up being twins. This feels symbolic. Like i was given the child i ended up not having in addition to the one i was to have then. It's comforting when i look at it that way. Like my love for them was real even if they weren't. So real that the baby just HAD to come into existence. ",

It‚Äôs amazing at helping to resist getting disoriented, brainwashed, and mindfucked when exposed to old  abusers or triggered by exposure to new ones, like in a job for example.\n\nA few weeks ago, while visiting, my mom acted out in a way that I haven‚Äôt experienced since I was a child (I‚Äôm 34 now, I‚Äôve had low/no contact for a year from both parents). It was destabilizing and retraumatizing to a startling degree and behavior that I‚Äôd forgotten she was capable of.\n\nI experienced a pretty severe dissociative/trauma paralysis shutdown for 36 hours and then started googling for any new-to-me books on covert parental narcissistic abuse.\n\nDr. Sherrie Campbell‚Äôs books are brand new. 2022 and 2024. They‚Äôre heavy, but I don‚Äôt know if anything has ever validated my experience to the degree that her books have.\n\nPeople who have not been abused by their parents really struggle to be able to accept the depths of cruelty that are possible. It can be so lonely.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶just wanted to chime in and share her books in case any other fellow members of the shitty parents club could benefit from the resources. They‚Äôre both on Audible, I rented mine from my library audiobook apps.\n\n1000/10 recommend. Therapy, too, of course. These are great books to keep you company while screening for a therapist who understands that this type of parental abuse exists. I cannot overstate the importance of working with a clinician who has had experience working with survivors and does not have a cognitive dissonance response when this type of sadistic and, at times, covert pathology is disclosed to them.\n\nWishing you peace and healing <3",

I planned out how to provide for the baby, thought about names and really grew to love this baby (who ended up not being real). I was ready to drop out of high school, fully grieving the loss of my own youth but excited to bring a little life into the world.. and then I found out after around 2 months that I wasn't pregnant after all (I can't even imagine how you felt after 5!!). My period also didn't come back for another few months, which made it even harder to really accept. I've never met anyone else who really understood that grief, and I was told by a lot of people that I shouldn't be sad because there was never a baby there to begin with. My partner at the time even called me crazy for being heartbroken and needing to grieve. This all happened 5 years ago but I still think about that baby, and I'm not a mother yet but it made me realise that I want to be someday. I think it was also part of what finally made me realise that I needed to leave the abusive people I was around back then.\n\nAnyway, I guess I just wanted to share and let you know that you're not the only one and that it's completely understandable and normal to grieve.

It‚Äôs amazing at helping to resist getting disoriented, brainwashed, and mindfucked when exposed to old  abusers or triggered by exposure to new ones, like in a job for example. \n\nA few weeks ago, while visiting, my mom acted out in a way that I haven‚Äôt experienced since I was a child (I‚Äôm 34 now, I‚Äôve had low/no contact for a year from both parents). It was destabilizing and retraumatizing to a startling degree and behavior that I‚Äôd forgotten she was capable of. \n\nI experienced a pretty severe dissociative/trauma paralysis shutdown for 36 hours and then started googling for any new-to-me books on covert parental narcissistic abuse. \n\nDr. Sherrie Campbell‚Äôs books are brand new. 2022 and 2024. They‚Äôre heavy, but I don‚Äôt know if anything has ever validated my experience to the degree that her books have. \n\nPeople who have not been abused by their parents really struggle to be able to accept the depths of cruelty that are possible. It can be so lonely. \n\nAnyway‚Ä¶just wanted to chime in and share her books in case any other fellow members of the shitty parents club could benefit from the resources. They‚Äôre both on Audible, I rented mine from my library audiobook apps.  \n\n1000/10 recommend. Therapy, too. These are great books to keep you company while screening for a therapist understands this type of parental abuse. I cannot overstate the importance of working with a clinician who has had exposure to this type of sadistic and, at times, covert pathology. \n\nWishing you peace and healing <3",

I found her after a lengthy online search. cPTSD is still not an official DSM diagnosis (yet), but it‚Äôs real and getting more and more recognition. She was a ‚Äúbetrayal trauma‚Äù and cPTSD researcher. \n\nChronic mistreatment by the people who are supposed to keep you safe creates cPTSD and betrayal trauma and affects‚Ä¶everything. \n\nThe recovery is long and not without very real challenges, but OP I read other comments that confirm you are living proof that there can be a new story on the other side of this type of abuse. There can be joy and hope and a different future. \n\nI wanted to add the betrayal trauma concept because I saw the comment about your stepdad now being (or seeming) like a reformed father to his bio-daughters and that it further complicates your experience of his abuse and trying to maybe make sense of things.

No client should feel like they have to comfort their therapist (the therapist can be emotional after when they are alone). Often clients go to therapists, instead of their friends and close ones, because they don‚Äôt want to deal with other people‚Äôs emotions when they are struggling with theirs.",

You listen to emotional stories and CONTAIN them. You can get slightly glassy eyed when it is a patient you know well, but basically this is about modelling. You show them that their stories might be horrible, but they can be managed. \n\nIf I as a therapist feels awful just HEARING about this, that means that you should‚Ä¶basically give up, right? Because this is too horrible to handle.\n\nNO! I can manage this. So YOU can learn! \n\nBut we can show emotions. But only vague ones. And only when we actually think that is good for the patient. This is all about them. In that room I am a therapist. I am not a person, I do not count. It‚Äôs all for them.",
