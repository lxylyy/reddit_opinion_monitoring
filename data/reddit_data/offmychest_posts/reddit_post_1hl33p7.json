Not because you’ve experienced the “great transification of your children” but because some influencers and politicians figured out how to milk you for attention and get rich and more famous off of your dried teets. \n\n\nThis paranoia rotted more brains than it should’ve.  Grow the fuck up, you’re an embarrassment to the world, and im so pissed your fucking people think they’re smart enough to vote when they’re too dumb to realize they’re being manipulated. ",
