  "title": "My cousin killed himself. It's like he chose to do it in the most selfish way possible. I can't mourn his loss because I'm absolutely fucking furious.",
  "selftext": "My cousin shot himself in the head on Saturday morning. Guns aren't a big thing in this country, so no idea where he even got it from. Police took it. He killed himself in his childhood room at my aunt's house while she's in hospital dying of cancer and was hoping to return home soon so she could die in comfort with the small family we have left. Woman looks like a skeleton already and is barely breathing. She's probably only got a couple weeks left in her at most and she knows it. She's had a hard life and just had to have her older brother tell her that her only child killed himself today. She had to be told how when her brother told her that she can't see the body. I know that losing a parent hurts. I've lived it. He couldn't have waited just a couple weeks to give that woman the tiniest comfort at the end? He left a note saying that he \"loves us\", mentioning us all by name, and saying that he's sorry he's \"going first\" and that it's \"not our fault\".\n\nThat's all well and good but you know who had to clean up his entire fucking head on Sunday? Me. I guess it makes sense that the police don't just handle that for you, but I didn't expect it all to just be left exactly as it was for me to handle by myself. I wasn't even aware that the mess was there the first time I walked in to the room. I knew he had died in there, and knew he had shot himself, but it was like a horror movie. I think I just froze. I called the police and they apologised profusely for the lack of forewarning and suggested cleaning services and gave contact details. I called them up and several were closed, and I was told I would have to wait three or four days due to backlog and the bank holiday. I've got a kid at home I'd much rather be spending time with before he has to go back to school next week, but it's been very warm lately and I didn't want to leave it for long in case it started rotting and attracting flies, or if my aunt needed to come back home, so I started cleaning up by myself. I just wanted to get it over with. As soon as I thought I had successfully cleared an area I would find bits or blood specks on a surface you'd have thought would be impossible to hit, or some almost cement-like dry clump clinging to something. I just gave up at some point on \"cleaning\" pretty much anything that wasn't a hard surface, and decided that throwing most things out made sense. So much of it felt like I was just diluting and smearing it around. Every time there was a chunk that wasn't water soluble I felt sick. Did not take the time to try to figure out what they were. I had to take apart photo frames with pictures of my family, and him and me as children, to clean bits out of the corners. Tore out and cut up the carpet, bedding, bagged up all of his clothes that were out in the open. Recoiled in disgust every time I felt something through the thin gloves. I'm in my 20s. I wish he was still here, we got along well, I loved him dearly, but it's all just being overwritten by the intense anger I feel at him leaving me and everyone else around him in a position where we have to handle this while we all have so much else going on. If she even manages to survive for that long, given how badly she took the news, he's made it so the final act of his mother's life is probably going to be attending his funeral.\n\nI wish I could have helped him more when he was here but even more than that I wish I could just scream at him \"if you're going to kill yourself at least do it in a way that won't fuck over everyone who you love and who loves you on the way out. \"",

I contemplated not having a memorial because I was so goddamn angry that he‚Äôd deprived us both of a father and my mom of a partner right as her chronic disease was hitting its peak. I was angry with him, angry at the bar that over-served him and let him leave drunk, angry at my cousins and uncle who he was drinking with that let him drive away, angry that he could have killed someone l, and just angry at the world in general. \n\nIt took a long time for me to realize that anger is normal, but holding onto it for too long isn‚Äôt. I spent the first few years of my early twenties hating any mention of my dad because I was so mad about it. As a result, I missed out on a lot of experiences with friends and family, dropped out of college, and broke my relationship with my mom. \n\nI highly recommend professional therapy.

But confident as you might be in that assessment, you don't want to be 3 months out from now, losing interest in everything that once brought you joy, cloistered away in your home, not responding to loved ones, well on your way into depression or worse. Even if *in this moment* you don't need it, a therapist can provide a tool kit for use in the future to understand the warning signs and leverage techniques to help you through bad times.\n\nI'm speaking as both a survivor of suicidal compulsions and one who's been deeply affect by a loved one's suicide. You think you're good and then a year later you're self medicating with booze and spiraling and insisting you're still fine somehow.

Bear in mind, this is often true in greater or lesser degree, for example, in the case of a fatal confrontation with a home invader.  And what you probably don't need to hear, having been forced to learn it for yourself, is that you should just think about it as what it is: meat.  But I write in case it's helpful for you to think of it in memory, too, as just that: meat.  The material that made up the man, but which was not the same thing as the man, and which, in itself, is common and no big deal.  It can be easy to get overwhelmed when confronted with something laden with multiple meanings and fraught with emotion.  And *we don't talk about* the natural disgust and frustration of cleaning up a corpse, even of a loved one.  But the disgust is one thing, your loss is another, your moral indignation is still another, and so on.  The failure to untangle these different aspects from one another may have made the event, and may make the memory of the event, more traumatic than it has to be.

We go through life buoyed by assumption and trust.  All of what you say may be true, about your aunt's hard life, about the selfishness of the form your cousin's suicide took, but there's probably no reason to think that this is all that's true.  There are often all kinds of subtleties in the relationships of parents to their children, children to parents, that are not only unknown, but incommunicable.  On the extreme end can be some pretty savage abuse.\n\nTry, if you can find a way, to use this experience constructively.

It's common for depression to warp the way we see ourselves and the world around us but Mental illness can also screw up  impulse control and the ability to fully rationalize.  \n\n In my mom's case, she lost *her* own mother to suicide 8 years before and she was devastated and furious at her for it. My mom had struggled with depression and unmanageable pain for years and would often have the thought cross her mind.  It made sense when she it popped in her head but disintegrate when the rational part kicked in and she realized how terrible that would be.    She must have told me 20 times over the years that she'd never do that, but as time wore on and she started to understand her own mother better it scared the hell out of her.  She saw a Psychiatrist, took her medication and from the outside should have been okay.   Until the one day the thought crossed her mind and she didn't take the next step in time. \n\nAs parents, when a child gets upset and bites their siblings we try to teach them it's wrong.  They may learn it's not approved of but it's not until we get older that we can actually fully reason why.  Mental illness can screw up the ability to do that. \n\n\nThat's not to say there aren't rational people who do this and people are never selfish.   Did they normally knowingly do things to hurt others?  Did they care how people saw them? \n\nLast thought on this.  I've gotten flack for it, but I feel that sometimes anger helps. It's a little easier to have something to redirect all of that pain to rather than having it weigh your heart down.  I can't imagine doing what you did with nothing but grief and despair.   I suffer from depression and can understand my mom but every Mothers Day and on every birthday, I get angry.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.  What you've done for his mother is incredible.",

But I couldn't unsee it later. \n\nMy biggest advice is to know that all of your feelings are valid, including anger.  Seek grief counseling, even just in the short term and they will give you things to do to help.  Tetris was recommended by others, it helps with avoiding repetitious thoughts about the traumatic event, and prevents it from permanently embedding in long-term memory.

But if it hasn't, I hope it can help.¬†\nI lost 2 of my dearest friends to suicide. Over 20 years apart. The first, he was like my brother. In some ways, my platonic soul mate. We had similar backgrounds of abuse, depression, and helped each other through a lot. In my yearbook, he actually wrote that I had saved his lige multiple times. Because he was already close to the edge and we talked it out. I can't express the guilt I felt at not being able to save him when he did it.¬†\nBecause I was also suffering from depression, I never saw it as selfish. I truly couldn't understand how anyone saw suicide as selfish I had made one attempt myself, so I mean it when I say there is no selfishness involved. In that moment, or in the time leading up to the suicide itself, the person comes to believes some very specific things.¬†\n1. They have no value. Of any kind to anyone. Not only will no one miss them, most of their friends and family will be...if not happy, then at least relieved they are dead. This isn't a passing thought. This has become a fundamental truth. The world will be better off without them in it. In a way, in their mind, they are being selfless. Although that thought isnt usually that clear. To them, they are removing a problem for everyone they love. This has such a hold, any positive words are just being said to be nice and anything negative, even the most diplomatic constructive criticism, is proof they should just move on and be done with it. So when people are trying to tell them they are really loved, no one actually means it in their minds. It's just the social expectation that kaes those words come out of anyone's mouth.\n2. There is zero possibility for the circumstances, the way people REALLY think (in their own minds), or life to get better in any way, shape, or form. If anything, things will only continue to get worse. The best case scenario is things stay exactly the same. Which are already unbearable.¬†So what's the point of going on?\nWhat's important, and extremely difficult for people who have never felt suicidal to remember, is that this is a mental illness. Like a physical illness, it's not something you can wish away, talk someone out of, or even use reason and logic against. A type 1 diabetic can't tell their body \"Hey, I ate all the right foods, did the correct amount of exercise, didn't cheat with a soda do now you HAVE to produce insulin. I don't need the shot!\" A mentally well person can't lay out all the reasons suicide is a bad idea and it get through the mental illness barrier. For rhe reasons I explained above.¬†\nAnd like physical illness, it's not a one shot fix. A type 1 diabetic needs insulin for life. A mentally healthy person can lead a more typical life, but only with the correct treatment. And if that treatment is removed, the illness is still there.\nGoing back to my best friend like a brother, he made a VERY serious attempt in HS. It's a genuine miracle he failed. His mother had a mom moment that saved his life. At least for a while. He got medication and a phenomenal therapist. He was good. For years. Until he aged out of his dad's health insurance. He was still in college, working part time at Target. No health benefits were (or are even now) offered to part time employees in most states. He couldn't afford his meds, therapy, and basically stopped everything cold turkey. So believe me, I'm mad. But not at him. At a health care system made for profit and not to care for people. Mayne I'm wrong, but I believe with my entire being he'd still be here if his care had continued, uninterrupted.¬†\nThis is already so long, but I also want to mention a different type of suicide, although I don't think it applies to you. It's with someone with a terminal illness, usually some kind of cancer. This is specific and almost always done to protect the loved ones of the sick person. They want to spare their family amd friends the pain of watching them suffer and waste away. Especially if they experienced it once already and wa slycky enough to go in remission. I don't have personal experience on this one but I do know that the person isn't usually thinking of avoiding the suffering themselves. To them, its 100% about their loved ones being spared.\nWhat helped me in my personal battle happened at my soul brother's funeral. Seeing all the people that showed up. Seeing their pain at losing him. I realized that people would miss me. And I have never felt suicidal since then. But it took seeing that for me.¬†\nI'm not sharing all of this to tell you not to be angry. What you feel is what you feel. I've said all of this to offer an insider perspective and maybe at some point, you can be open to being angry at the system that fails the mentally ill instead of your cousin. And if you can't, I sincerely hope you can find peace at some point anyway. Because you deserve it. No one should have to live with anger, hate, resentment, etc. Except maybe Hitler or other truly evil people. The can eff off.\nGood luck you ü©µ",

Loss of a person is one devastating thing but having to put in the physical labor to take care of things adds to the landslide of emotions. I am sorry for your son, for your poor aunt!\n\nOn a personal note, coincidentally, I have been thinking of my cousin who died by suicide a few years ago in his father's newly constructed house. It's his birthday in a couple of days and we were born 3 days apart so I can never go through this time without thinking of him. He was married just a month before he died, and nobody has a fucking clue why. Though it was an arranged marriage, he was keen on it. \nI can only think of the years of depression he had endured after losing his mother really early in life, the lonely years after with a distant dad and interfering relatives in the name of caretakers but he had agency, having moved out of the home country. He was an excellent astro-photographer pursued several hobbies and had loving friends. However he went back home willingly, isolating himself, got married, and then a month later he was just gone. There is so much anger and resentment in the family, his bride widowed so young in a country that is superstious and regressive about that sort of thing. Her family though rightly angry, directed the anger to financially draining my cousin's father. The lavishly built large house sits empty except for the photos of my aunt and my cousin hanging side by side. Everyone blames my cousin for his suicide, I blame his undiagnosed mental illness that he probably hid for years and while I feel terrible for everyone, I just wish he had directed the amount of time he took to plan his suicide (more than a couple of days prep to procure items, cordon off the area etc etc) into talking to someone trusted.

I can speak from experience when I say that depression is like a hot coal, it burns and aches relentlessly.

She has to die with the recent knowledge of this. OP is not a bad person for feeling angry about it. It sounds like you need to seriously learn some compassion as well. OP‚Äôs cousin definitely deserves it because he clearly was in a severely fucked up mental state to do that.

I haven't made it about *myself*. Even after having to clean him up, which I am angry that he would leave for us to do, I'm pissed off on behalf of my family. If he had ended his life any other way, place, or time then I would have been able to mourn like I would want to be able to in this kind of situation. Even if I still, for some reason, ended up having to be the one to clean him up.\n\nThis caused the maximum possible harm to everyone we both love and I am left picking up the pieces. It could not have been more hurtful if he had tried. It's hard to feel anything else through all this.\n\n>And youre complaining that you have to clean his body remains up when you would rather be playing catch with your ruddy kid? Dude. Your kid isn't going anywhere man. This is so messed up to me.\n\nMy kid is adopted. Two years ago, at the age of seven, he was witness to the sudden death of his father, his only remaining family member, and one of my dearest friends. Both he and his father wanted him to live with me because I could offer him safety and stability. He was not coping well early on. He barely spoke. These last two years my cousin went out of his way to grow close to him. To comfort him, and to make him happy. I told him all the time how much I appreciated what he was doing, that I was so grateful that he would step in and make such an effort to give this kid a new family that felt present. Seeing him open up over time has been such a relief.\n\nHe tore himself away from this kid right before he's supposed to start school. If you really think that you could sit, like I had to, and tell this nine year old kid that his favourite new family member was dead, and not get angry that you had to put this kid through this loss all over again, then I don't know what to tell you.\n\nWhen he saw his father pass we debated intensely on whether or not it was right to let him see the body before he was buried. After some discussion with friends, social workers, and a medical professional we settled on him seeing his father looking peaceful in a comfortable environment at the funeral home likely being more comforting than upsetting given how he had last seen him. We let him do so, and it did bring the kid some peace. The nightmares calmed noticeably after that. I am happy that we were able to make it so that his last memory of his father wasn't the accident. When I sat him down and explained that my cousin had died he just deflated and accepted it like it was expected. It broke my heart. When he asked if he could see him to to say bye, I had to say that he won't be able to say goodbye the way he wants to. He didn't let it show, and I don't think he has the vocabulary to express it, but I can tell that it upset him. I hated having to rob him of any kind of closure. He's just had another person up and disappear on him.\n\n>Did you maybe think for one moment, in between playing hide and seek with your kid, that maybe he did not have the capacity to deal with the death of his mother?\n\nYes. We spoke about it only days before his passing. I also watched my own father wither and die the same way only a year ago. I know *exactly* how it hurts, and he spoke to me about it often because he knew that I could relate. I offered to let him move in with me, and offered to handle everything in his life for him during this time so he could do whatever he felt he needed to. We were extremely close and spoke almost every day. We were raised like siblings. I don't know where you've got the idea that we didn't deeply care about each-other from. I'd do anything to have him back. Doesn't mean I can't be mad about what he did.\n\n>I really don't want to he insensitive but you don't seem to really be concerned about much to do with the actual matter of someone's tragic self destruction so I doubt you will take this with more than a pinch of salt.\n\nThat's because he is dead and gone. If he were injured but alive I would be a mess. I'd spend every second by his side. But what good would me being a wreck right now achieve? Make his mother's final days even worse and more stressful for her than they already are? Traumatise my kid even more? Work myself in to such a stress that I can't push through the overtime I am forcing myself through nearly every day to pay for almost all of his and his mother's arrangements? They all need me right now, and it shouldn't be like this for any of them. For me either.\n\nI am not religious, I don't believe that he is looking down at me or anything. He is gone, and I would like to be able to focus on being sad beyond belief that he is not here anymore, but I have an entire lifetime to come to terms with that, so can process it later. Instead I am trying to carry my entire family which quickly is sinking in in the chaos he left us right now.\n\nI knew him well, *far better than you,* and can say without a fraction of a doubt that if he could see how distraught his mother is. How quiet my kid has been since he heard the news. Or how stressed and overworked I am handling all of this, he would not think that my anger was misplaced. **He'd be absolutely furious at himself for not thinking this through too.**",

However, the way the brain protects itself in the immediate term can often cause us problems later down the track. Think of it like a physical injury: your body wants to close that wound ASAP so it doesn't get infected, and the fastest way to do that is creating scar tissue. A scar is better than an infection, but it's best if you get neither.\n\nTalking through what's happened with a professional isn't about helping you to feel OK now - your brain is already doing that.

It's estimated that *those* types of suicides would be reduced by 20,000 a year in America if guns weren't so common. This is because those people wouldn't have a way to kill themselves *immediately*, and the chances of them changing their mind goes up quite a lot, as well as the chances of people stopping them/saving them if they do attempt it by another method.",

      "body": "If it helps, upswings from very bad depressive episodes actually can have that dangerous moment for understandable reasons, so it is possible to know what is happening in the moment. It‚Äôs not that you start getting better and then suddenly drop down worse, it‚Äôs that you start getting better and you gain some energy back.  Making an attempt requires a massive amount of energy on a mental level, and in your lowest low you simply don‚Äôt have that. In this scenario, you hit the point where you‚Äôre capable of it specifically because you‚Äôre getting better. This is why a doctor may tell you to watch out for increased suicidal ideation when you first start antidepressants.\n\nI‚Äôve personally pushed past this, and advised others on how to push past it, by ingraining the idea of waiting 24 hours before going through with anything. Once you‚Äôve reached the point where you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre going to do it, what‚Äôs one more day? Why even care about what happens during that day, and if you can manage it, why not do some small nice things for yourself ‚Äúone last time‚Äù? You‚Äôll feel like waiting a day is pointless, stupid, and won‚Äôt change anything, but then you don‚Äôt really have a reason to NOT wait that day. Might as well. This works when you‚Äôre not on an upswing as well, but it‚Äôs also shocking how quickly and how drastically you just start feeling good when you are getting better.",
