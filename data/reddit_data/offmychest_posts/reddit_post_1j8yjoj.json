  "selftext": "I married my friend of 10 years in secret. We're both in our early 30s.\n\n5 years ago I moved towns, at 25, after a bad breakup. He had broken up with his ex about 9 months earlier. We were working through our breakups and ended up as FWB. At the time we decided to keep it to ourselves because we didn't want things to get messy. \n\nA few months later, we realised we worked really well as a couple and started formally dating. Again we decided to keep it to ourselves since the relationship was fresh and we didn't want to have to explain ourselves.\n\nThen 6 months after we moved in together. Us dating became our funny little in joke. 22 months after we bought a house together. Then a few cats. The following year we got married in secret. Our own family doesn't know we're married.\n\nWe're now coming up to our one year anniversary and we're talking about children. We've been together 4 years now in total.\n\nWe're not sure when the right time to tell our social group is, but right now we're still really enjoying the peace of a quiet life.\n\nWe are now wondering if we fake a formal engagement because the rabbit hole got too deep to explain.",

You could rent a vacation property and have a ceremony there as well but small small and do it quickly.\n\n2- come clean that you have been together for a while and it just got awkward not telling anyone and you sort of got stuck in the groove of not telling people.\n\n3- say nothing, start wearing rings and claim innocence… “wait don’t mean you didn’t know? We have been living together for years. We eloped but it wasn’t a secret. God we really should have people over from time to time”\n\n**while 1 is my favorite if anyone ever needs an FBI or thorough background check (lots of jobs require this) you will have to come clean on your actual marriage date.

It was a rather serious black-and-white discussion about how it would work. Neither of us wanted actually to date the other, but we wanted sex with someone trustworthy. After agreeing to be FWB, we both got tested simultaneously to raw-dog it. \n\nWe both agreed that whilst we were Shaboinking, we could see/date other people. We were both on Tinder talking to different people. However, the golden rule was that when you physically slept with someone else, that would cancel out the FWB agreement and we would no longer shaboink. This was to prevent giving the other an STD and also to prevent things getting messy with any new potential partner. \n\nThe problem was, I'd go on dates with new 'potential' boyfriends and always think \"Is this guy likely to be boyfriend material? Is he worth giving up my FWB agreement for? Do I want to wait a little longer to see how things go?\" Eventually, I realised our agreement impacted my ability to date others because I constantly did a cost-analysis on potential men and kept avoiding sleeping with guys. We agreed to cancel our FWB agreement and return to friends. We had a few on again, off again situations.\n\nThen one day, I went on an absolutely god awful date with a guy I met in a bar. Comically bad. The guy had been secretly live-updating our date on Twitter. He had an online dating diary where he talked about his dating life. Nothing bad really, just text posts like \"My date just asked me XXX, oh my god I'm so embarrassed.\" or subtle pictures of the date. My friends somehow found this and started following the updates, loving the tea, it got back to my FWB in a guys group chat. \n\nAt first he sat through the updates laughing about what the guy was saying about me. He said he had planned to roast me about it, but at some point, he said reality hit home, that he wasn't dating me, and that he felt insanely jealous and angry watching me on a date. He phoned me and asked if he could collect me, I said oh god yes this guy is a weirdo (not knowing about his twitter account). I got roasted online for leaving the date early by Mr Twitter weirdo. My FWB drove me back to his place and showed me everything, laughing and joking. Later that night he asked me to be his girlfriend formally.",
