  "selftext": "I know I‚Äôm gross, I know it‚Äôs disgusting, but my depression has been so bad for the past months I haven‚Äôt been able to get in the shower and do the whole thing. It felt so overwhelming. I would usually wipe myself off with alcohol and wet wipes every day and wear my hair in a bun every day because my hair was so knotted I couldn‚Äôt brush through it (not that I would want to because it was just a frizzy oily mess.) But today, I did it.\n\nI‚Äôve been cleaning all day. My roommate moved out recently, and I have another one moving in and I‚Äôve gotten so much done today. I‚Äôm supposed to meet my new roommate in a couple hours to give him the key and help him get situated. I hate the smell of cleaning products and my clothes were covered in them. So I just said ‚Äúfuck it, it‚Äôs time‚Äù I took a warm towel out of the dryer and wrapped myself in it while I brushed my hair for the first time in forever, it took almost an hour and I lost so much hair but I haven‚Äôt been able to run my fingers through it in months so it was a relief to see I still have most of it on my head. I put on a good video essay to watch and listen to while I‚Äôm in the shower and I did the whole damn thing. Washed and conditioned my hair with a deep conditioner, exfoliated my whole body (holy shit there was so much dead skin), scrubbed everything, shaved, did my hair routine that I haven‚Äôt done in months. \n\nI know it‚Äôs pathetic and stupid to be proud of myself for something so gross, but I‚Äôm crying seeing my curls again for the first time in forever, actually having my hair down, my skin feels soft, and I put on some sweatpants and a t shirt that were still warm from the dryer and it just feels heavenly. I‚Äôm typing this with blurry vision from the tears in my eyes and I just wanted to tell someone. No one in my life would understand and they would probably just think I‚Äôm insane tbh so I‚Äôm just gonna be happy with myself here. I‚Äôm gonna go get ready to meet up with my new roommate now.",

A quick shower wipe down is better than not showering at all. Collecting your empty cups and glasses at the sink is better than not cleaning up at all.\n\nIt started slow, but eventually, I got into small routines that helped keep me on top of falling back into that catatonic depressive state where I pretty much couldn't function, or when I tried to make a change it wouldn't be so drastic that I would be intimidated or overwhelmed.\n\nDepression is difficult for people who don't have it as a constant shadow to understand, and you're not silly to feel proud of yourself.

      "body": "I‚Äôm so proud of you! I hope you can remember how good it feels to be clean in clean clothes when you start dreading your next shower! I would love to share some tips for you and anyone else struggling:\n\n1) Shower at night if you can. When you‚Äôre depressed or if you find showers overstimulating exhausting it‚Äôs much easier to shower the night before you want to be clean and just crawl into bed after. In high school I used to wake up early just to have time to shower and then get back in bed for an hour afterwards. It‚Äôs ok. Anything that helps *helps* and is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n2) you do not need to stand the entire time! You can sit! There is no rule against it! If you can afford a shower bench that goes across a tub oh it makes a huge difference even just with shaving! Combine it with a handheld shower head and suddenly you don‚Äôt even have to get completely wet/naked you can sit, bend over and just wash your hair if nothing else. Even just rinse it! Don‚Äôt even have to shampoo and deep condition etc etc. \n\n3) you mentioned you lost a lot of hair, but in reality if you haven‚Äôt been brushing it for two months, you just took out all the dead hair that‚Äôs fallen off the last two months and hasn‚Äôt been able to shed naturally as it was up in a bun! This is a common thing people misunderstand. But I want to assure you, it‚Äôs normal hair loss you‚Äôre just seeing all that hair at once which can be scary. (If you are worried about hair loss and shedding get your thyroid checked as this can be a cause for depression and hair loss, joint pain and more)\n\n4) For the days you just don‚Äôt have the energy to shower, whole body wipes are amazing and you can even find them at Dollar Tree or buy in bulk from Amazon. Even just a wet washcloth will help. If you can‚Äôt wash your hair, try and brush it, if you can‚Äôt do that either braids are more protective for long hair, but do what you can! Nothing says you have to wash your hair every time you shower or that the shower is the only place you can wash your hair! Sometimes you only have energy for one or the other and that‚Äôs ok! You can wash your hair with a cup and big bowl of water, you can wash your hair in the kitchen sink (if you have long hair I recommend using the drain cover) I also recommend using dry shampoo between your wash days which will really help extend things.\n\nMost important tip I can give you is anything you can find the energy to do, is better than nothing. It is a kindness to yourself to do even the smallest thing even if all you can do one day is gargle mouthwash because you don‚Äôt even have the energy to brush your teeth. Be kind and gentle with yourself just like you would with a friend or child going through this. Tell yourself you are doing the best you can, you are doing *your* best and that is all that matters. There is no comparison to other people cuz everyone is different and we‚Äôre all just doing our best everyday. And everyday that best is going to look different. Highly critical and mean self talk ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so disgusting‚Äù hasn‚Äôt motivated you (or let‚Äôs be honest anyone) into showering and it likely won‚Äôt do it in the future, but kindness might get you there. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to sit in the shower with the water running and not do anything.‚Äù Yes!! üëèüèª amazing! Good job! That‚Äôs a great step and it‚Äôs so much more likely that ‚Äúwell since I‚Äôm here‚Ä¶‚Äù but be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to say, it‚Äôs ok for me to not do anything in the shower today.

I went from a cold to not being able to breathe  in 3 days. \n\nIt started as the flu, turned into rsv, strep, bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, sepsis, and finally, septic shock. \n\nI went to my local er, was immediately admitted into the ICU, and transported to a major hospital in the nearest major city.\n\nI remember nothing. I walked into the ER, told them I could not breathe, and woke up from a medically induced coma a month later. \n\nMy infectious disease doctor told me I was as close to dying without actually kicking the can as I could possibly get. \n\nThen, the septic shock started up. \n\nI went from a full head of beautiful hair, down to my hips, to loosing it all. \n\nI didn't shower for 3 months because every time I did, more and more and more of my hair fell out. \n\nIt was horrifying. \n\nI finally started showering again about a week ago when I would run my fingers through my hair and not end up with hundreds of stands of hair in my fingers. \n\nI lost almost all of it. \n\nI can not even put my hair in a ponytail. It is all gone. \n\nIt has been one of the most traumatic things I've ever been through. \n\nAt first I thought the dread locks from being in the coma was the problem.  I cried as my mom brushed them out for me. But it just kept falling out. \n\nSo I ignored it. \n\nI felt so gosh darn nasty. I could barely get myself out of bed.\n\nI finally accepted what was happening and got it all chopped off.\n\nIt took another 2ish months for it to stop falling out. When I finally ran my fingers through what was next to nothing, I forced myself to get in the shower and have done it every single day for the last week. \n\nI couldn't even look in the fucking mirror because I was so terrified that that alopecia would be permanent.\n\nIt's starting to grow back now but it has been one of the most traumatic thing I have ever been through. \n\nThis sounds crazy. I literally almost died because my son brought home a strand of the flu that my shot didn't cover. I couldn't talk, walk, eat, or really even think... but losing my hair has been absolutely horrifying. \n\nBut WE did it. We got in the shower, we cleaned ourselves up, and we decided that we are not going to do this to ourselves anymore. \n\nI'm as proud of you as I am of myself. \n\nIt might take years for my hair to grow back, but it will not take me years to take care of myself. \n\nI'm proud of you, and I'm happy you kept as much as you did. \n\nOne day at a time. \n\nWe wake up, we make a decision, and we follow through. \n\nMy therapist told me it takes two weeks to turn a chore into a routine.
