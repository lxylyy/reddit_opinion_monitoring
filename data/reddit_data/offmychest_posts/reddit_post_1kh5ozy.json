  "selftext": "A year ago I (20) was raped by an insane gross methead (50). He offered me drugs when I was so drunk I could barely walk. We got to his apartment, he raped me for five hours while I was drugged up. \n\nHe left for the bathroom sometime during it, I managed to grab my phone and started an audio recording. It's three hours long and it's horrible. I never stop saying no, begging him to please stop, please let me go, sobbing, struggling. \n\nI turned it over to the police who have sat around twiddling their thumbs doing absolutely nothing for a year. He walks free, I see him all the time, small town. I reported it because I didn't want anyone to be hurt in the same way. \n\nThe police and hospital repaid me by informing my parents about this even though I specifically asked every single person I met during the process to please not do that (that's illegal btw).\nBackstory finished. \n\nYesterday I walked into the store and see Mr. Meth sitting on the floor. I was quite drunk (drinking problem who?). I walked up to him and spoke to him for the first time since it happened. He said some disgusting vile sexual things and made gestures that make my skin crawl just thinking about it. \n\nHe then asked me why I would involve the police, and said: \"Why didn't you just say no?\"\n\nI kind of lost it, I responded in the only appropriate way by kicking his face in. It was in broad daylight in public, security and police were called, but I got him good. He was yelling and whining about how there were cameras and the police were going to get me. It was the most cathartic amazing thing I have ever done. \n\nI went outside to smoke while waiting for the police. I was frustrated that it was taking so long, so I went back in and just attacked him again. He was better prepared this time but I got in many glorious punches to his head and face. \n\nEventually the cops arrived, they put him in the back of the police car and spoke to me. After he was gone I was just a sobbing mess. I told them the whole truth, that I was the one who instigated it, that I was quite drunk, what he'd done to me etc.\nTo my absolute bewilderment, they let me go? Maybe they felt bad for me since I was sobbing so much. They arrested him and put him in the back of the car, and I was free to leave.\n\nThey gave us both the same assault charge. I don't really know what to make of all of this, but it was deeply satisfying and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. \nBesides, if he didn't want to get kicked in the face, why didn't he just say no?\n\nThanks for reading <3\n\nEdit: You are all so very sweet, I wish I could reply to every single comment ü´∂ I just had to tell someone about this, and all the support has made me feel so much better about everything. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, you all deserve the world ü§ç",
