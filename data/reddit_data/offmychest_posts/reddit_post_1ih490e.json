Everywhere only pays federal minimum wage around them and if they have no car, their choice of employment is restricted to the employer of the person who can give you a ride.

They can't clean themselves, so you end up stuck cleaning up the mess in the bed constantly while cleaning them/giving them baths.\n\nAnd they're miserable too. They know they're dying. They feel helpless and ashamed.
