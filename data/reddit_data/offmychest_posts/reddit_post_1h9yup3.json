  "title": "My mother killed my sister ",
  "selftext": "It happened just over five years ago. My sister was 23, I was 16. I was still living at home, my sister was visiting. \n\nOur mother has always been... Difficult. I don't want to diagnose someone, but she's always had mental problems. My sister had bipolar disorder, but actually took responsibility and managed her disorder. The two of them often clashed. \n\nI can't remember why it started, but they began arguing. My sister started preparing to leave, but had stopped just before going down the stairs. My mum shoved her. Not hard, but just hard enough to cause her to lose her balance. She fell down the stairs onto the tiled floor. I still remember how it sounded. \n\nAlmost immediately, she started gurgling and seizing, throwing up as she bled onto the tiles. Mum was screaming, I was screaming, she eventually called an ambulance. \n\nThey took her away and we got into mum's car, driving to the hospital. We didn't talk, we were both crying. \n\nWhen we finally got to the hospital, we found out she was already being prepped for surgery. They told us to wait and that they'd inform us as soon as there was an update. \n\nA few hours later, a doctor came up to us. There was nothing they could do. My whole world crumbled. She was my big sister, my protector and best friend. She took care of me and loved me. I once read that losing your parent is losing your past, losing a friend is losing your present and losing a child is losing your future, but losing a sibling is losing all at once. \n\nIt was only mum and I in the house that evening. We never talked about what happened. But I whenever I look at her, whenever I talk to her, I can just think *you killed her, you took her from me*. \n\nThis is the fifth Christmas without her. I keep thinking about who she would have been today. Would she have gotten married to her girlfriend? Would she have gotten her degree and followed her dreams? Would she be proud of me? \n\nI've been in therapy since it happened and it's helped a lot. She was also an organ donor and the thought that parts of her are out there, making sure a handful of people got to live, is such a comforting thought. \n\nI should have told someone the truth about what had happened. But there was so much going on, my mind was in such a disarray that it didn't even occur to me. But it wouldn't have changed anything. My sister is still dead. \n\nI miss you, Nea. Miss you so fucking much. \n\nThank you for reading. \n\n\nEDIT: I did the wrong thing not reporting it back when it happened. I'll report it tomorrow. Hopefully it will lead somewhere. ",

      "body": "OPs silence on this murder protected her life, and she had no choice.\n\nI want you to remember your feeling of getting in trouble as a kid, the fear of punishment. Your heart pounded, mouth went dry, you breathed faster, mind raced in complete fight, flight, or freeze response. But for the majority of children, they had loving, safe parents and still felt this. Why? Because all children know subconsciously that their survival depends entirely on the pleasure of their parents.\n\nSomething I've not seen anyone mention is the fact that OP was a minor that had just witnessed her sole -caretaker- kill her beloved sister before her eyes. To me, that's a clear psychological message of the power a parent holds over a child. The literal representation of, \"I brought you into this world, I can take you out of it\" threat many of us grew up with. OP witnessed what happens when you earn the displeasure of her mother, whom she depended upon for survival.\n\nIt wasn't spoken, and it probably wasn't even intended. Nevertheless, it was read loud and clear subconsciously. The message doesn't erase on the 18th birthday, because if we're real here, it's just another day in a long string of days and won't imbue anyone with greater power or strength. Remember none of these concepts are conscious, all subconscious. It takes time to recognize where \"feeling\" and \"instinct\" come from. To survive psychologically, one had to shove these thoughts down deep, after all. As OP mentioned, the topic was forbidden.\n\nOP is very brave to seek justice for her sister, and I commend her. For those wishing her continued silence so she would not lose her mother, I counter, what is the loss? They barely speak as it is, having to dodge the minefields her crime left behind. She can be forced to get the help she needs behind bars and be forced to face what she did to both her girls. She destroyed two lives that day.\n \nHire a lawyer, don't talk to cops without representation with you at all times. Make sure you gather your evidence from therapy, and affidavits from friends testifying you said your mom killed her over a long period of years (to prove you didn't suddenly decide to pin it on your mom because of a fight).

She got clean after about 5-6 years and was clean for two until my adoptive mom/great grandma died. Everyone blamed me because I didn’t know that her wrists hurting meant she was having a heart attack lol. Anyways ig the pain was too much for her and a year later she ended up getting back with him and relapsing. He laced this guys wax with fentanyl and then went and laced my sisters meth with it too (he admitted it to me) I was in my room (across from hers) when I hear him telling her to talk to him. No response. After 8 minutes maybe he busts open his door and tells me to call 911. I do, I walk in and see my sister naked on the ground with her back on the floor (20 minutes prior she was fully dressed in my clothes) and unresponsive. I closed the door so her five kids wouldn’t see and my bio mom opened the door and they flooded in. Long story short, I was 16. The adult in the house didn’t know anything about the abuse or drugs. I was the only one taking care of the kids and telling the cops what happened previously and right now. They didn’t know I was a minor until they asked me for my ID. My bio mom and her two kids (13 and 14) were just talking shit and telling the kids their dad killed their mom (very inappropriate) lol longer story short, everyone blames me for “not speaking up” when I did. I told my oldest sister (I’m the middle child) about the abuse, rape, and drug use. She chose not to believe me because of my age. Recently I found out my bio mom was the one giving him the drugs. Absolutely nothing I can do now. \n\nMoral of the story, we were kids. I’m 18 now and i realized like it’s not our fault yk? You were a kid. You probably couldn’t fathom your mom pushing down your sister so you just pushed it to the back of your mind. I didn’t think my sister was gonna overdose, especially not on fentanyl due to her fear of it but it happened yk? Don’t beat yourself up for it. We were literal children.",

I wasn’t even sure if he was successful because he grabbed my backpack handle and yanked my backpack back so I flew back and that was more jarring than being touched on the butt would’ve been since I play contact sports and you get slapped everywhere either intentionally or unintentionally when you play sports so it’s nothing new. I was traumatized mostly because it was just another incident of kids being assholes and laughing at my expense- not so much the touching the butt part- and I wanted to talk about it because my therapist kept telling me I have a victim mentality and that’s why bad things happen to me.

Do you really think it will make you feel better to see your mom prosecuted over this? Do you think there could be any worse punishment for her actions than the natural consequence she experienced? Nobody is even asking these questions before jumping straight to wanting to throw this woman in jail.\n\nI don’t think retribution is the answer to your ongoing pain. Quite the opposite. I think you’ll only heal once you find it in your heart to forgive your mother for what was surely the worst moment of her entire life, and find some kind of empathy for what she went through alongside you. The worst day of your life was probably tenfold for her. Can you even imagine having such an intense consequence for such a relatively benign offense (getting frustrated enough to push someone?) Can you imagine living with the guilt of your actions leading to the death of your own child? Doesn’t matter whether she got along with her—that is some heavy shit right there.\n\nI hope all of the folks brimming with righteous indignation have never once shoved someone in anger—or made any mistake that could have had dire consequences, but didn’t. “There but for the grace of god go I” is an unfortunately underused sentiment in our deeply punitive culture.
