I always have.\n\nMy mother, on the other hand‚Ä¶\n\nWe live with her temporarily. Financial reasons. My mom is helpful in some ways, but she‚Äôs always been nosy. I‚Äôve caught her reading my daughter‚Äôs diary before. I told her, firmly, to stop. That it was a boundary. That it was not okay.\n\nShe cried, made herself the victim, and promised never again.\n\nLast week, I came home early from work and saw her on the couch reading it.\n\nNo shame. No apology. Just said, ‚ÄúYou should see the things she writes. She‚Äôs depressed. She needs help.‚Äù\n\nI told her to stop. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her grandmother, I have a right to know what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù\n\nNo. She doesn‚Äôt. She broke my child‚Äôs trust.\n\nMy daughter hasn‚Äôt written in it since. She told me, quietly, that she feels violated. That she doesn‚Äôt even want to stay in the house anymore.\n\nWe‚Äôre moving next month. I told my mom she lost the right to be alone with my child ever again.\n\nAnd I meant it.",
