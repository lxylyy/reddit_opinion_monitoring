  "selftext": "I just knew. I just knew today would be a good day. \n\nNormally I don‚Äôt like going by his work when I get off as traffic is usually ridiculous and I‚Äôm already exhausted. \nBut I had a strenuous day at work and his restaurant has great food and drinks and aren‚Äôt typically busy on Mondays. Traffic was light due to the rainy weather, and I was able to get off work early for once. \n\nI picked his son up from school and we were on the way. Anticipation building up in my stomach. Excitement. \n\nWe pull in, his son and me get out, hand in hand, walking up to the glass front doors, waiting for him to notice‚Ä¶..\n\nAnd boy‚Ä¶when he did‚Ä¶\n\nHe shut his eyes and threw his head back, hand clutching his chest, nearly tearing up. \n\nI let go of our son‚Äôs hand and let him go run and hug and comfort his father with arms wide open and the biggest smile. They held each other so tight. Two steps behind, as I walked up, my soon to be husband was so quick to discreetly grab us both, keeping us close, off to the side to give me a proper embrace. We all hugged, his grip was tight. \nHe finally pulled away, seconds feeling like minutes, looked me in the eyes with a mix of sadness and anxiety and said ‚Äúhow did you know? How did you know I needed you today?‚Äù And I just looked him in the eyes and said, I don‚Äôt know, but maybe because I needed you too.\n\nThe look in his eyes, filled with love and relief when he saw us, the way he lets us know he is ours, just reassures me that this man is whole heartedly committed to me and us and our future, and I could not be more blessed. \n\nEdit: thank you (almost) all of you for such sweet words! Your comments warmed my heart. To the rest of you, I‚Äôm flattered that you think this could be AI or wattpad? Lol. Nope, just someone who appreciates literature and story telling, but thank you nonetheless. ",
