Tours, albums, etc. It‚Äôs exhausting and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to go back. I still love making music, but I used to love performing and interacting with fans. Now I feel like I‚Äôm trapped. I know a lot of people dream about being in my position but I‚Äôve been just so burnt out. I wish I could walk down the street without feeling like everyone is watching me. I wanna go to the grocery store without a hoodie and sunglasses pretending I‚Äôm someone else just to avoid being ‚Äúspotted.‚Äù The constant pressure to be perfect, always ‚Äúon,‚Äù always performing. it‚Äôs exhausting.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for everything but damn the personal cost feels soo heavy. Having a real conversation with someone outside the industry feels impossible. Everyone is either in it for the clout or some connection. It‚Äôs hard to tell who‚Äôs genuine and that‚Äôs a lonely place to be.\n\nLately I wonder what my life would‚Äôve been like if I‚Äôd never gotten famous. Would I be happier? More grounded? Guess I‚Äôll never know but I can‚Äôt help but think about it more and more lately. \n\nAnyway thanks for reading, I‚Äôll prob delete this soon.",

Then maybe reveal who you are to them after a year or two of friendship/when you feel comfortable.¬†\n\nEdit: I was thinking. I have internet friendships where I‚Äôve been friends with the person for over a decade and they have no idea what my name is or what I look like. I also have friendships of the same length where I‚Äôve gone to their weddings. There is no reason to reveal yourself unless you want to and real friends won‚Äôt care. All my internet friends, whether they know my real name or not, still just refer to me by the nickname for whatever username I had when we met.¬†",
