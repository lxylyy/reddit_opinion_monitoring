  "selftext": "Hey guys. It’s been a rough week. \n\n\n\nA lot has happened. I don’t really want to talk about all of it in detail so I’m going to keep this short. I know I never shut up, it’s just how I am, but I’m going to be much more brief this go around. \n\n\n\nLuke has a lawyer now. I don’t know him. But he met with Zack and Paige. To everyone saying I should have Amy arrested, I probably could have if I had shown the police the video. Instead, I just sent it to my lawyer. Maybe this makes me foolish, but even now, I think part of me is still trying to protect people I once loved and go easy on them. \n\n\n\nBut everything’s been on hold for the past few days, because Jim had a heart attack. \n\n\n\nI saw Luke and I saw Amy, and Amy’s kids, at the funeral. It was the first time we were all together since before all this happened. Nobody talked about what’s going on, short of Amy briefly apologizing for “what happened” before. She did seem sincere, I’ll give her that. But I wasn’t about to call her out anyway. Amy, Luke, and Cat all seemed pretty devastated. I was too. But we all agreed not to argue or talk about the divorce and to just let the day be a ceasefire to focus on Jim. Luke and I had a nice conversation about him. \n\n\n\nI’ve been spending time with my kids and taking a couple of days off work. I have enough of them on the back burner. Luke also saw the kids, twice, before and after the funeral, with me present. It went well. At my direction, and Sophie’s, they didn’t mention Amy, and Luke didn’t try anything funny with any of them. I think he does miss them and hate that he can’t see them, thanks to all this. \n\n\n\nThe kids are also pretty upset about losing Grandpa, on top of not being able to see Dad as much as before. I don’t think any of them blame me but that’s far from the point, frankly. Carter slept in my bed the last three nights. \n\n\n\nI’ll get more into this in the future when I have the energy to talk about what’s going on in more detail. But whoever suggested that Cat lied about the test results was correct. She never sent them in. She confessed as much to me. I guess she didn’t feel comfortable going behind her son’s back…but did feel comfortable lying to me to protect him? Until she didn’t, until she felt guilty, and she came clean. Under the circumstances, I am not angry with her, but I know better than to trust her anymore. As far as I know, she did not tell Luke about the test. But it means Tom could still be Luke's son. Probably is. \n\n\n\nMy  lawyers finished going through Luke and Amy’s letters with a finer tooth comb. The bottom line is, they definitely found what it was that Amy didn’t want me to see, and I now completely understand why she was so panicked. It has to do with why Amy and Luke didn't marry conventionally. They did something very bad. But this is genuinely something that I’m not sure I should be talking about, even on an anonymous internet post. I haven’t even been able to collect my feelings about what Amy and Luke have done, especially with everything else going on, so I don’t know if I should be more explicit. I’m sorry, I know that’s not what anyone wanted to hear, but please try to understand. Paige agreed with me, that when in doubt, don’t post it. I’ve told my lawyers to put a pin in it for now because I’m in no fit state to figure out how to proceed with it or if I should use it against them. \n\n\n\nI’m just feeling like shit, honestly. It’s difficult not to blame myself for Jim. I can only imagine Luke and Amy are blaming themselves too. I know they’re bad people. I don’t forgive them. But this tore them apart as it did me and I think all three of us feel like the divorce stressed Jim out to the point where it may have contributed. He already had heart disease. And in particular, I blame myself for showing him what I showed him. I showed him \"proof\" of the affair shortly before he died. I'll be carrying that with me for a very long time, even if I shouldn't.\n\n\n\nI’ll update again whenever I do. I’m sorry. I’ll respond to comments as I can. ",

If they believe you can share this illegal/very suspicious situation to you and your children's therapists, do so, to at least figure out how to explain that situation to them. Whatever that situation was that caused them not to be able to marry us at the heart of everything and it IS affecting you and the kids. Don't be like your soon to be ex, or Amy, or Jim and Cat.

Be honest and transparent with your kids but obviously in an age appropriate way with the therapists help. \n\nIf your lawyers push for you to use this \"illegal\" situation/info, do so. Remember they are looking out for you. Also remember that they tend to butt heads so if they are in agreement on this, it really is the best course of action. I think Paige especially wouldn't steer you wrong. Stop protecting Luke and Amy and to a lesser degree Cat. Your kids, are the ones that matter, again be open with them as much as possible. Hiding or avoiding isn't going to win you a stable, healthy relationship later in life with them if they find out.

At the end of the day, you will be getting a divorce, but Amy should pay for physically abusing you by extentions emotionally abusing you. She’s going to get away with it, please don’t let her. Did you not file a police report? How will you protect your kids from Amy in the future? Wouldn’t this be a way to prevent her from access to your kids? Please don’t protect Amy over the wellbeing of yourself and your kids. She doesn’t deserve it. Please don’t live to regret this later.\n\nRegarding what Luke and Amy did, if it’s illegal you should keep that in mind as far as protecting your kids especially if limited or no contact from both Amy and Luke. Please don’t protect Luke and Amy at the expense of your kids anymore. OP, I am scared for you and your kids. Amy was so scared about her secret that she was going to do anything to keep you quiet and destroy the evidence. You said that it was something morally wrong and illegal. Do NOT expect them to not hurt you or your kids to protect themselves, they’ve done it for the last few decades. They have proven that Luke and Amy will protect themselves first even over all kids involved. Please don’t believe that they have the same level of love and protection you have/had for them for you. Don’t fool yourself. \n\nI’m worried about your being emotionally vulnerable especially now that Jim has passed and they will try to emotionally manipulate you for the sake of “peace” or using Jim’s death in some way to get what they want. I’m sorry Cat lied to you when you gave her your trust, it’s unfortunate that she will protect Luke even when she knows how wrong he is. You are right to not see Cat as a trustworthy person anymore and nor is she an ally going forward. Her loyalty will not be with you but with Luke and Amy.\n\nI know you are in state where you feel like when it rains, it pours. You didn’t think things could get worse. I’m sorry you are going through so much loss. I bet you are feeling a ton of grief right now with the loss of your marriage, “best friend”, family unit structure, FIL/in-law relationship. I wish I could give you more comfort so you feel less alone. I’m sending a virtual hug.\n\nIn your situation, I think you need to lean into radical acceptance/Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Using radical acceptance when dealing with infidelity, betrayal, and divorce can be incredibly challenging, but it can also help you heal and move forward. Radical acceptance in these situations doesn't mean that you condone the betrayal or that the pain will disappear, but it helps you acknowledge the reality of the situation so you can release feelings of resistance and find a path toward emotional recovery. (see thread)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Questions:\n\nDid the kids act weird around Amy at the funeral? \n\nHave you or kids been to a therapist yet?\n\nHow did Sophie react when you told her about Cat not sending the DNA test?\n\nWhat was the conversation like when Cat told you the results were back? What did she say? Did she say Tom is not Luke’s child?\n\nWhen Luke initially started staying with his parents and they were questioning him about the affair, did Cat reach out to Amy to ask her if it was true? I’m wondering if Amy would have confessed or lied to her face. In truth, Luke and Amy denied his parents of being officially grandparents to Amy’s kids for about 18 years.\n\nSince they couldn’t marry conventionally, does that mean that they can’t marry in the future after your divorce?\n\nHow did Amy meet Jim, Cat and Luke? ",

The mother was a hollygolightly who mostly partied and did drugs.  My GF grew up without any meaningful parent involvement and thus lived a feral life. Started having sex at age 12 and using various drugs around the same age. By the time I met her (around 20) she had slept with well over 100 guys.  There was a time when she walked in and found her mother having sex with a guy she was then dating.  That level of dysfunction.\n\nShe was stunningly beautiful and wicked smart, but as I got to know her I could tell that she was a cauldron of seething rage lurking just beneath the surface.  As incredibly sexual as she was, I grew to be fairly certain that she hated men and was likely gay. I broke up with her because I didn't want to be in her path as she discovered herself. It terrified me.\n\nHer cousins all had similarly tumultuous lives. One was a sex worker. One was in and out of juvie, then jail, then prison. Etc.\n\nI relate this to illustrate how pathologies like violence and abuse, once infused into a family, can manifest itself for generations. As an aside, this is exactly the vector for the pathology we see nowadays in a lot of the black American community after roughly a century (1900 - 2000) of apartheid as prosecuted in the US. But I digress.\n\nI'm going out on a limb here, but not that far. Jim was a dirty dawg. Amy was his biological daughter, and Luke's half sister. She's white, as is Jim. Her daddy in and out of stir, mama died young, I'm guessing Amy came from poor white trash.\n\nBased on the fact that Jim mated with the mother, I'm guessing Jim did too, but in some manner he managed to amass substantial wealth. There aren't many ways to grow wealthy from a poor background without being ruthless and mean to some degree.  Or dishonest, such as being an evangelical pastor.\n\nWhich leads me to now go further out on a limb. Cat is a Korean immigrant. A lot of Korean immigrants are hardcore evangelicals. I'm guessing that this is an element in your extended family. It explains why Cat would look the other way as Jim's love child spent increasing amounts of time with the family, eventually living with them. It would also explain why Cat looked the other way as she almost certainly knew that Luke and Amy were becoming intimate, and then parenting children. It would also explain why Jim kept himself so aloof from this mess he literally spawned.\n\nSpeculation aside, what you have described here is truly awful, especially for Amy's children, who will never recover from what they will learn about themselves. Amy and Luke are clearly monsters for bringing them into the world in this way, but they are themselves victims.  The literal seminal root of all of this is Jim. I realize Jim has recently passed and there is a sense one should not speak ill of the dead. But if this series of revelations actually did trigger Jim's heart attack, in the end, it was because Jim himself was the source and cause of all of it. The guilt ultimately rests on him.",

They never told Amy nor Luke they were half siblings. Until Amy got pregnant in high school, when they told Luke's parents thinking they would be happy for them (best friends getting together, being pregnant, high school sweethearts kind of thing). Jim and Cat had to come clean about their relationship (half siblings). Amy got an abortion, and Luke and Amy cut their sexual relationship off. Until they couldn't stop, because, they didn't \"feel\" like siblings. But they also knew they could NEVER be together because it's illegal. But eventually, they got back together. It's why their stories of denial were SOOOOO rehearsed and OP even said, that if she hadn't seen the affair evidence herself, she would have believed their denial. With Luke married to someone else, Amy and Luke were free to have sex and even have kids because \"LUke WOulD NeVer chEAt!\" But Cat suspected their relationship became sexual again but Jim was in full blown denial, until confronted with the photo evidence. Cat wouldn't have sent in the DNA testing because even if Tom wasn't Luke's, Sophie and Tom would have some connection of relativity (sibling/cousin) which would have caused OP to look even deeper. But she didn't have to, because it sounds like Amy and Luke probably talked about their \"forbidden\" love in their messages to each other. It would make sense why Amy was so distraught about OP learning about it and wanting everything deleted because it would expose not only herself but Luke and the children. (Note: it would also explain why Amy doesn't talk about her parents and Luke's family is all she has, because Jim is her father and her mother is not involved or not alive). It would also explain why OP wouldn't want to share it, even on an \"anonymous\" website like Reddit. That could potentially get out and that would most definitely dox them. Plus, this would be devastating for ALL 8 kids. Not just Amy and Luke's. OP and Amy's kids have half siblings/cousins from their father and aunt. And Amy and Luke's kids are siblings from their half sibling parents. OP is in a rough spot and more than likely she will never confirm or deny because of the ramifications for the children. F*CK Luke and Amy, she probably thinks they can rot in wherever they lie, but the kids. She loves all the kids. This is a.... probably for most people...a move to a new city across the country and tell people your family is dead type of situation. I can't imagine any other \"secret\" that would be so devastating that OP wouldn't share what it was. But again, all my speculations and imagination running wild has produced this theory.

Which, if Jim knew Amy was his from the get-go, would be another reason he'd put her kids in the will.  But Cat and Jim used to argue about Luke fathering Amy's children, because Cat suspected but Jim insisted it could never happen.\n\nI don't even know if Cat knows now, but it makes perfect sense if Jim told Luke and Leia (lol) they were siblings, but to keep it a secret from Cat so she didn't leave him due to the affair.\n\nThat would also normalize lying (and cheating) during their formative years, which also tracks.\n\nWhile it's not illegal to have a consensual adult relationship between siblings, it *would* mean they can't marry, it *is* taboo, and it *is* unethical when considering any developmental issues their children could end up with.\n\nBut the \"very bad\" thing Luke and Amy could have done was ***knowingly have children of incest***, and learning that after all he'd insisted otherwise could definitely have triggered Jim's heart attack.",

Their judgement and ability to be good parents and make sound decisions around their kids and ability to keep them safe is in question if they thought nothing of having biological children together and never used protection to insure this didn’t happen. Luke engaged in fraud by marrying you if he was already involved with Amy and then went on and had children with both of you. Neither of them show that they can make good and safe choices for the kids.\n\nThe statistics around incest is bad in many different ways and there is a very real reason it’s illegal. If Amy was underage when it started there could be questions around consent. As a half sibling in the home there could be a question whether there was coercion even if not blatant. Did she feel her standing in the family was more secure and stable if things were good with Luke? It would matter here when the sexual relationship started and who instigated it. There can be mental health issues for those involved in an incestuous relationship as well as for the children from this relationship.\n\nAmy and Luke should have to face the full consequences for their actions. They made a choice again and again and again to become involved in an illicit and illegal(hypothetically) relationship and then chose not to use protection, and to do that again and again and again. They never made a choice in all these years that was not selfish, illicit and illegal and these choices were damaging to their kids, mentally and possibly physically. The children’s doctors need to know so that health concerns around this can be addressed proactively. Those are very real concerns and not always things that are present at birth but come out as they age and develop. Those statistics are not inconsequential which is why relationships like that are illegal. That they never gave this concern due weight or action or dug into what it would mean is neglectful and harmful to those kids.",

Because they are siblings.\n\nYou, and your kids, and Amy’s kids are truly innocent in this situation. Frankly, I think your kids need to know. As do Amy’s. Maybe not until they reach a certain age, but they do need to be told. I only say this because nothing ever stays a secret forever. Especially family secrets.\n\nLook at your situation. The truth is coming out. In a way that is gutting you. If you guide the conversation with your children once they’ve reached an age to grasp what is being said. If you have therapy scheduled and ready to go for your kids once they hear the news. With the therapist briefed as to what needs to be discussed. Maybe it should even happen in therapy. (Talk with your therapist about this option. Get their take.)\n\nIf you handle this as mentioned above they will have the strength of your full support and the benefit of a therapist to process the information. Make no mistake, this will be difficult for them. However, that difficulty will be quadrupled if they find out on their own in a way that is unsupported. This is a matter of knowing this is going to hurt but choosing which method is going to cause them the least amount of pain.   \n\nOne other thing to consider is that they see you as a place of safety right now. If they discover this, and discover that you knew but kept it from them, they could easily pull back from you as well. Leaving them with no one they feel they can trust in their whole family. They need to know that at least one person isn’t actively working to keep secrets from them.   \n\nAmy’s kids need to know as well. For the same reason. Secrets never stay secret. In addition to that they need to know from a health perspective. There may be things they face physically that are connected to incest. They also deserve to know the identity of their biological father. However, I get that you don’t get to choose when they find out.\n\nI’m assuming Cat doesn’t know this secret? She knows they have been having sex. If she thought they were siblings it seems like she would be significantly more distressed about this than she has been. Up until this point it has appeared that she disapproves but isn’t torn up at the very thought of them being intimate.   \n\nWhich means she doesn’t know Jim had an affair? Which begs the question as to how Luke and Amy know when Cat doesn’t know?  Did Jim tell them but not her? Did they find out on their own? This just reiterates that secrets never stay secret.\n\nYou have been facing one unbearable hurdle after another. With big decisions on the other side of each obstacle. The good thing is that nothing has to be decided right this very minute. Take a deep breath. You will get through this nightmare. One step at a time.",

I'm assuming somehow Jim fathered Amy and somehow brought her into their lives and incorporated her into his family. But, it's certain they know they are half-siblings but still engaged in incest. \n\nIt all makes sense, from why they are so close. Why they are so protective of each other. Why they are publicly not in a relationship and never have been. It explains Jim's reaction and them being against ancestry kits. Also, why Amy destroyed your laptop with proof and her insisting that she shouldn't be involved/documented as an affair partner. Jim financially supporting Amy and her kids are added to his will.\n\nIf it's the case, you need to take some steps to distance yourself from both Amy and Luke. To protect yourself, in the event it does come out and you don't look like you were aware of it or condone it. You may not want to expose them because incest is illegal but you can take actions to show you don't condone their relationship.\n\nYou need to file a police report regarding the assault and get a restraining order. So, Amy can't come near your kids. As far as I am concerned, Luke and Amy are a threat to your kids and even Amy. They willing engaged in a sexual incestuous relationship and had incest babies. If Luke hadn't got a vasectomy they would kept going and kept inbreeding. Amy chose not to have birth control. They both lack ethics, moral and judgement due to their disgusting fetish/kink.\n\nSince they don't care that they are committing incest, they would have allowed Sophie and Tom to have an incest relationship knowing their are half-siblings as well if you hadn't protested. If Luke and Amy don't care about them committing incest, I'm VERY worried that they might commit incest acts as siblings to their own children! They are immoral! Do whatever you have to do to prevent Luke and Amy from incest relations with the kids! Please don't be blind that it couldn't happen. There's cases of multi-generational incest. \n\nIf needed to, you should remove your kids from that environment leave the area or Luke needs to leave the city and get away from everyone. Luke and Amy should not have any contact with your kids. Luke is not a good father! A good father doesn't inbreed with his half-sibling. You need to make it clear whether it's letting them know you know about them that you don't condone their relationship. And, you SHOULD use the info to your advantage to protect your kids. I would not feel comfortable with Luke anyway near the kids. I would be questioning his behavior until now if had incest thoughts of any of his daughters. \n\nWhat will you tell your kids? Does Cat know? If not, will you tell her? I don't see how Amy and Luke's affair won't come out. Tom and Sophie already suspect it. Amy's kids could always do a 23 and Me kit later in life and their wouldn't be a reason to stop them. Whatever happens, it's not okay for Luke and Amy to continue their relationship and later you knew and didn't say anything (if you are thinking of not telling the kids).",

The number I gave you in the comment above (BGHst. 35, 347) is actually the case number of one of the weirdest and most insane cases you come across in law school in my country. \n\nThis is in Germany in 1988 (the case happened in 1986, but the final verdict is from 1988). It is commonly known as the “Cat King Case” among German law students and jurists. I’m gonna give you a quick run down of the real case as I can’t remember exactly what our practice case was, but it was a toned down version of this. I’ll try to keep all the “fun” details in:\n\nIn 1986, a woman we’ll call B learns that her ex-boyfriend (we’ll call him U) is getting married to a woman we’ll call A. Since B is pretty jealous of U, she and her partner P decide to manipulate police officer M, who has a crush on B and is, as he thinks, in a relationship with B, into killing A. M is of sound mind but very gullible and superstitious.\n\nFor that purpose B and P convince M of the existence of a mystical “Cat King”, who has been around for millennia, is the embodiment of evil, and threatens our material world. They convince M that the Cat King demands a human sacrifice from M as “punishment for his many mistakes”, and that this sacrifice must be A. If M didn’t deliver that sacrifice, he would have to leave B, or at the very least millions of people would be killed by the Cat King in A’s stead. \n\nM obviously struggles with the idea of killing A, but, believing B and P, he ends up deciding to go through with it “in order to save millions of lives.” \n\nP hands M his sheath knife and suggests he best attack A from behind when she’s in her flower store. Shortly thereafter, M enters the flower store and pretends to be there to buy roses. When A turns her back on him, M pulls out his knife and delivers twelve stabs into A’s neck, face and body.

He offered a compensation between €200 and €3000 to women who were ready to administer electric shocks to themselves while he was on camera with them via Skype.

He instructed women to either make sandals of aluminium foil or hold spoons to their temples and connect them to a wire which they should then plug into the power outlet. He would record the Skype session “for research purposes” (he actually just intended to use it to repeatedly jerk off to it). \n\nHe had no intention of paying his victims and would always disconnect from the session after the women had administered their “test shock”.\n\nLuckily none of his victims died, but some got really bad burns, especially the ones with spoons on their temples. \n\nA was convicted of attempted murder on 13 counts.

This of course is a crime but can happen for a wide variety of reasons. In Germany, the punishment for this *can* be as low as 5 years, depending on the circumstances. \n\nThe latter adds certain aggravating circumstances, which make the crime particularly heavy and deplorable. These circumstances can lie in the motivation or in the way the killing is performed. In order to go about this in a structured manner, these circumstances, which are a more or less conclusive list (meaning if none of them appear to be met you have a tough time making “Mord” as a prosecutor), are divided into three groups. \n\nGroup one is personal motivation: out of a lust to kill, to obtain sexual gratification, out of greed or otherwise base motives. \n\nThe last one is the one that leaves the door open for extreme cases to be judged as more despite not meeting any other criteria of the list. Since the entire list is applied in an incredibly restrictive manner, you very rarely see a conviction based on “otherwise base motives”. \n\nGroup two concerns the nature of the killing act: perfidiously or cruelly or by means constituting a public danger. \n\nGroup three concerns personal motivation again, but in relation to other crimes: to facilitate or cover up another offence. \n\n“Mord” instantly means the perpetrator gets life in prison, which is why these requirements are applied restrictively: if applied they lead to the maximum punishment.\n\nThe word “murder” (Mord) is really only associated with the latter in Germany. It’s a common fun thing for first year law students to ask their non-jurist family members: what do they think the differences between Mord and Totschlag are. Most people get it wrong. \n\nAs you can see, “to obtain sexual gratification” is in group one, and in real life it is one of the most common occurrences among “Mord” cases. The human mind can be deprived as fuck.\n\nProper Mord cases with Mord convictions are very rare in Germany. It’s a big country with a population of over 83,000,000. The last numbers I could find quickly are for 2020, but in 2020, 150 people were convicted of murder, and 96 of attempted murder.",
