  "selftext": "My wife died around Christmas, it wasn't natural or accidental. She lost her battle with depression and it's been hard on us but we have been doing our best to manage. I'm trying to be strong for my daughter. She is only ten years old and it was hard on her especially because it was around the festive season . My daughter's birthday is this weekend and while we were just chatting during dinner last night, I asked her what she wanted to do for her day.\n\nShe usually looks forward to her birthday like any other kid her age and loves choosing what she gets to do. Although this time I was secretly hoping she would say something I can afford at the moment like she wants to get McD's or something like that but her reply completely threw me off. She told me that the only thing she wants for her birthday is to see her mom just one last time then she burst into tears. That completely broke me, I could only hug her and comfort her all while fighting back my own tears.\n\nI know it will get better in time because we do talk about how she's feeling about everything often and she also talks to someone at school as well but it just tore me up and I will never forget that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "There are some really beautiful ideas in this post already.           \n\nHere are mine:          \n\n* smell is the strongest link to memories. So if your wife had a perfume, soap, deodorant that she used regularly, get your daughter a mini sized one or pop some in a leakproof container so she can smell it anytime she wants to.           \n\n* in the tv show Criminal Minds one of the characters wives is killed and she left behind a young son and husband. They had a candle that lived by his son‚Äôs bed, they would light it and ‚Äútalk to Mum‚Äù. I always thought it was beautiful as it‚Äôs like turning on a light to get mums attention so she can listen to whatever they have to say.            \n\n* ask anyone and everyone who knew your wife to write about her in whatever format (handwritten, typed, or even video) especially when she was younger - it‚Äôll be a great thing for your daughter to read as she gets older. Let people know not to censor anything, that you‚Äôll do that for your daughter - at 10 she‚Äôs a bit young to hear about drinking and skinny dipping for example. Also ask for copies of photos and anything else they have. It‚Äôs to build a memory book for your daughter and you. A way for you both to connect to her.         \n\n* any video or voice recordings you have of your wife get someone who‚Äôs good with tech to duplicate it on to multiple different cloud storage or usb sticks. People often comment they forgot what someone sounds like. This will give you both something to play/watch when that happens.           \n\n* While she‚Äôs grieving her Mum, you‚Äôre also grieving your wife, you need to allow yourself space and time to do so. It‚Äôs also good for your daughter to see you grieving. Not to the extent she feels like she has to care for you. So reach out to people to take care of your daughter while you go for a drive, see a friend, or a therapist, or a support group, both of you need support.           \n\n* I say this with deep compassion, given how she died, both of you may experience anger, even rage at her and that is absolutely normal. It‚Äôs incredibly normal, and healthy. Please remember to let it out in healthy ways - you can write her a letter, yell into the void, punch a pillow etc. Your daughter can express these emotions to you, and you need to be supportive but not judgemental or try to change her mind. Let her  vent, express herself and give her options for outlets. You however, need to find one or more safe people you can talk to about it. You can love your wife, know logically what happened and why, doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be angry at her. It doesn‚Äôt mean you hate her, or miss her any less, it‚Äôs an emotion that will pass.        \n\n* this is off topic for birthday, she‚Äôs 10 so it‚Äôs likely she‚Äôll start her period sooner rather than later. I‚Äôm not aware of any period products that expire so when you can start a little emergency kit. Pads - with and without wings, various sizes, tampons again various sizes, hot water bottle or heat pack you can pop in their microwave. If you‚Äôre not sure if your wife spoke to her about periods, in a few months you‚Äôre going to need to. This will likely be the first uncomfortable thing you need to talk to your daughter about, but you can do it and you‚Äôll do just fine at it. Please tell her that while cramps are normal, so is a little pain but if she‚Äôs in serious agony, it impacts her ability to live her life to let you know so you can get her to a gynaecologist.              \n\nYou‚Äôre an amazing Dad, I know this by how open she is with you.            \n\nI‚Äôm sorry to both of you for your loss.",

Some suggestions I think of is maybe you can create a tradition with your daughter. On my dad‚Äôs birthday for instance, I‚Äôd buy a dessert (usually cake, but I‚Äôll get a pie or something instead depending on what‚Äôs going on) and have it as his ‚Äúbirthday cake‚Äù since he was a real sweet tooth. You can always do something similar, like buying your wife‚Äôs favorite sweet/dish/snack and doing something she would‚Äôve loved; walking on the beach, favorite movie of hers, something to live her memory by. It can be a great way to remind your daughter of the good memories she has with her mother, and you can help remind her of your wife by sharing memories/stories. Sharing memories should be a regular thing of course, but doing a reminder is always good on the special days.\n\nAlso, this is something close family-friends did for my brother and I. Can‚Äôt remember when it happened, but they took two of my dad‚Äôs t-shirts (that were his favorite) and stuffed/sewn them into tshirt pillows. I still have mine, but when I missed him I‚Äôd hug the tshirt pillow since his hugs is a thing I miss. Do you have shirts or something that you can use to turn it into a pillow or even a blanket? I‚Äôve seen families online make clothing of a passed loved one into a quilt as well, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be a treasured item your daughter would love.",

Take a tshirt of your wife‚Äôs and spray a little of the perfume into it, or wash your hair with her shampoo and rub your hair with the shirt. Anything to transfer the scent. Put the shirt on her favorite teddy bear and refresh the scent from time to time and tell her that any time she misses her mom, to hold the teddy close and tell her to smell it. Write down what her perfume smelled like, what her shampoo smelled like. Our sense of smell and our sense of hearing are the things that make us recall memories the most. I was younger than your daughter, and my mom‚Äôs perfume smelled like gardenias. I didn‚Äôt know that, just the brand. One day, when I was 19 years old, I walked by something that smelled of gardenias and I was like what on earth is that smell, why do I recognize it? It‚Äôs because of my mother. Go get a journal, a nice one, from Staples or your chosen office supply store. Write in it the memories you have of your wife. From how you met, all the way to before her death. If you can get your friends and her family to do the same thing it‚Äôll matter. Save all the pictures and videos you have of your wife on social media for your daughter. Make a scrapbook. I hope you have home movies and hopefully she had home movies from before she met you. Watch them with your daughter. Tell her all the good things, and the bad things when she‚Äôs ready. But don‚Äôt be afraid to talk about your wife. Don‚Äôt be afraid to let your daughter see how sad you are. You‚Äôre mourning your wife, your partner, but she‚Äôs mourning her mother and she needs to see that you care. Hell, pick her up and hold her in your arms and cry together.

Tell your daughter her mother is her guardian angel and always watching her and won‚Äôt ever leave her. Hell, lean the fuck into it and buy an angel figurine for the house, like her room. If she asks what happened, please for the love of everything in this world do not lie to her. But make sure you tell her her mother loved her and wouldn‚Äôt have gone away if she wasn‚Äôt in the pain she was in. But even if she‚Äôs not there anymore, she‚Äôs still with her daughter in her heart and her mind and she can carry her with her everywhere she goes. My heart breaks for you. I never wanted another little girl to go through the hell I did. If anything I suggested helps, then good. I‚Äôm so sorry. Please tell me if there‚Äôs anything I can do. It‚Äôs okay, to break in front of her. Being strong is good, but it‚Äôs also important for her to see you sad. Sharing in the sadness is what you can do right now.",

When he died I remember crying myself to sleep so many times I lost count.  It went like that for several years.  I was left with vague memories of spending time with him, like waking him up from a couch nap, going fishing on his boat, him introducing me as his son (I felt so proud to be his son), and a few other good memories, but not much else.  He wasn‚Äôt present in my life, and I resented him for a long time in my early 20‚Äôs, but as I‚Äôve grown into my own and surpassed him in living years (I‚Äôm three years older than he was when he died), I forgave him and now I understand life from his perspective.  It doesn‚Äôt make it right, but I think understanding his life as he saw it makes it feel better in some ways.  He had successfully beaten cancer in his early 20‚Äôs, and was in remission for about a decade when it came back.  He lived for another 7 years after that, and was constantly in and out of the hospital, tired, on and off chemo and radiation, flying out to Washington DC to take part in some experimental treatments (targeted chemo and radiation treatment).  Ultimately it ended by taking his life, I saw him one last time at his home when he was in hospice, he held my hand, I hugged him and we cried.  About a week later he passed away.  I have a lot of pictures and some things he kept from his childhood as well as mine.  For a long time I put them all away and refused to look at them, it just hurt too much.\n\nAll that to say, I wish someone had done that for me, sat down with me and my sister to go through old memories, tell stories about his life, talk about the good memories.  I did eventually do those things, but I feel like it would have been better to do that much sooner than I did.  My family was absolutely devastated by his loss, he was the baby of the family of size kids, everyone loved him so much, and it hurt all of us dearly to remember his life.  So we just shut it off, and eventually I had to navigate my grief by myself an adult.\n\nOP, you need to do something with your daughter, don‚Äôt let her forget the person her mother was, dedicate a special day, like her moms birthday, to remember her specifically, until you both feel like you‚Äôre ready to move on.

This can be individual for you and your daughter or it can be a family therapist who can see you together. (Or both.) School counselors are phenomenal and a crucial resource for students, but especially in a case like this a specialist would really benefit you both.\n\nYour school counselor may be able to help connect you with a therapist. I don't know where you live but if you‚Äôre in the US and your daughter goes to a public school, I'm guessing she is on either an IEP or 504 plan to let her see the counselor this often. If that's the case, you as the parent should be able to invite the therapist or family therapist to meetings, which would allow that grief specialist to have more direct input on how the school accommodates your daughter. (And if she's in a public school and NOT on an IEP or 504, that's a conversation worth having with the counselor.)\n\nTo be clear, you're already doing an incredible job as a dad and husband.

It must have been so devastating not having anyone to talk to about it.\n\nTalking about a close family member or even a friend's death is hard, even more so under these circumstances. But no matter how hard it is, people need to find it in their hearts to talk about the parent, acknowledge the parent and find something positive to say. They don't need to focus on how it happened or why. The child/children need to know this wasn't their fault. They don't need to feel guilty or ashamed, they need to know they did not cause this to happen. \n\nMy friend hung himself in the family living room while the kids were at school and his wife was at work. Unfortunately his son was the one who discovered him. I can't even begin to imagine the trauma that young man felt.\n\nI hope you were or are currently able to talk to someone about your mom's death and are doing better now. Sending you warm thoughts and cyber hugs. Take care.\n\nEdited to correct spelling error.",
