No one could enter my room without a hazmat-looking setup - which scared me to see. They had me on oxygen for 7 of my 13 day stay, with cameras in my room; every 6 hours, a respiratory therapist would hook me up to a machine that shook me violently (two get the gunk out of your lungs). I later learned that those cameras were monitored consistently for the first several days that I was there, because they weren't sure that I was going to make it. I also learned that the last patient who had that room never made it out alive. I dont have family - my then-bf was all I had - so when my phone died after 18 hrs of trying and failing to get a hold of him, I was certain I would die alone in that room.\n\nHe eventually figured out where i was.... 2.5 days later. I \"forgave\" him because I was so sick, and he was all I had (how would I pay rent? Who would take care of my dogs? And me???) - but, like you, I never *really* forgot...

Your husband CHOSE to hurt you and your child. He CHOSE to abandon his child from the very first breath he took. He CHOSE silent violence against his pregnant wife in the most vulnerable moments of her life.\n\nOP, why are you trying to convince yourself of lies that HE’S not even trying to convince you of?

He should've been there, he should regret it for the rest of his life. His reaction or lack of must make it harder. At your most vulnerable, when you needed him, something so important and life changing, \"his boss wanted him to finish his shift\" is unacceptable. He has to live with what he did, he has to tell people he failed to show up for the birth. By 6 hours?! The nerve of him! \n\n\nYou won't be able to forget, because you were in labour and gave birth.

But unfortunately, at almost the exact same time she started having contractions and I was getting ready to take her to the hospital, I suddenly became extremely sick. The sickest I have ever been in my entire life, violently throwing up about every 20 minutes or so. At about the same time the she was taken into  hospital, I was taken to my local Doctor. I happened to mention to one of the nurses there before I was seen by the GP that my wife had just been taken to hospital to give birth, and she scornfully suggested my being ill was probably psychosomatic, despite the fact I was lying down in agony continuing to vomit. Once the doctor saw me, he quickly realized I had some kind of gastro bug and arranged for me to be taken into the same hospital as my wife, where I was put into an isolation room where I continued to vomit like crazy until early the next morning when I woke up feeling much better - and straight away received a few photos of my son who had just been born. A few days after I was discharged, I was formally diagnosed with having Noravirus. It was just such a cruel twist of fate that this happened at precisely the same time my son was born. I was honestly so sick there was absolutely no way I could be there, and they wouldn't have let me in anyway. They were even reluctant to let me see him later that morning once I'd recovered enough, but eventually allowed me in wearing full protective gear/mask etc. Sorry for the wall of text, but I still feel terrible that I couldn't be there, and still can't believe that this happened.

Staying at work while cover was sorted, handover notes tidied, etc, for an hour or two is reasonable. What he did, not so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy husband was at work when my waters went with my second, a week before her due date. I was at home with our then-three year old eldest. I called him to let him know. He asked me how I was doing, how urgently I needed him, etc. \"No contractions yet, and I need to pack a bag and stuff still. Not super-urgently.\" He asked if I was OK with him finishing a few things up and coming home in 2-3 hours. Having had one baby I was pretty confident that was absolutely fine. (She was delivered on a pitocin drip about 36 hours later.) If I'd said the contractions were coming thick and fast and I needed him, he'd have dropped everything and come home ASAP.\n\n\nWhen I had our third, the contractions woke me up. I resettled the middle at around 3 AM. My husband sleeps **heavily** and I couldn't wake him up, so I ended up calling a taxi at 6-ish; he woke up around when it arrived and insisted that he should take me instead, in case my waters went dramatically mid-journey. So we got two confused, tired littles out of bed and into the car; called my parents around 7 to let them know to expect the girls; he dropped me off at the hospital shortly after, drove them to my parents and was back with me around 10, 10:30 (they live about an hour away and he had a knee injury so needed to break up the drive). He joined me in the birthing suite for a little while and was there when the midwife broke my waters, felt an elbow, and I was rushed downstairs to the doctor-led bit for an emergency extended C-section to remove the baby lying sideways at noon.\n\n\nHe did an amazing job keeping me calm and I actually ended up with a bit of I guess third-hand COVID medical trauma thinking about how, if the bub had waited until his due date, I'd have had to do that alone. Going under to be put back together, I didn't worry because I knew that my baby was with his daddy and was getting loved on from the get-go... And like, with our first, he was the one holding my hand and reassuring me that I wasn't going to die but that if I did he'd definitely still love the baby, when I was slightly hysterical and a bit out of it on gas and air at probably something like 5 AM.\n\n\nOK, when I was hooked up to the pitocin drip and IV antibiotics with our second, and on an epidural, things were mainly civilised and relaxed and slightly boring for the most part, but he was also the one monitoring the drip levels and flows and letting the midwife know when I needed bags changing (she was very clearly new and he works in healthcare).\n\n\nHaving somebody who makes the person having the baby feel safe and heard, and who they know will champion their needs, is **so** important. No, it doesn't **need** to be the father - a parent, other family member or good friend can also fill that role - and midwives etc are generally awesome... But numerous studies exist showing that labour progresses better when women relax, and feeling safe helps with that. And you'd generally expect - or should be able to - that your spouse and the father of your unborn child will fill that brief.",

Did not grow up in the US, that's all ill say on location tho. \n\nOur school was pretty far from our house like 30-45 mins by bus or traffic in the car. So the bus was not allowed to forget kids.. They checked or remembered all the kids on it but.. Anyways one day i was left behind. First time it ever happened. \n\n(Folks told me this story btw. My mum has repeated it many times so I'm also speaking from memory of what i was told.)\n\nDriver called my mom when he realised i was forgotten..(idk if this was on the way, if he stopped somewhere to use a payphone or if he came by the house or not. This is the one thing I'm unclear on, maybe there was a phone on the bus? I think there used to be but i cant remember when n what years ANYWAYS..) \n\nBut when she learned this, she called the hospital and my dad who dropped everything n drove over right away. By the time he got there he should have expected to find me in the vice principals office, the teachers lounge or the general downstairs area. He said it was empty. He said he was walking by a few rooms to try another area and from the outside saw a \"white blurr.\" (So those doors were all solid but had a thin long window down the side) the lights were OFF in that room (but afternoon so it was not night dark but like still... dark?) he stopped and looked in and was horrified to see this old guy lifting ME onto a tabletop + several other little kids in the room sitting down next to another man. If i remember right, on a bench..(The old guy was wearing a long white shirt = blurr).\n\nMy parents btw are not the chill type. They are both city folk and migrated to this country.. My folks, when angry, they are terrifying. my dad LOOKS scary but has a kind heart. Both my parents have loud voices and when it comes to fighting for someone or something, they become a terrifying force. Anyway my dad can be scarier, he, rightfully so, YELLED at this man. Asking what the hell is happening, he took me into his arms, questioned them but these men were village folk n didn't speak English i think? The old guy was the guy who minds security and the front gate at the entrance.. Either way he got no answers from the old guy. He ended up taking the kids out of the room, going to the principal's office, making a fuss with the principal and vice principal. He called my mum, the staff, asked to call ALL parents of those kids left behind (idk if they called the police tbh they may have, or solved it by threatening to call the cops. Idk i could ask? But if i ask my mom will worry why im even asking after all these years. But i could ask.) \n\nThey questioned what the hell are grown men doing looking after the kids left behind? Why on earth is it a room with the door closed, with the lights off?? Why the heck are they not supervised somewhere in a room or class with female teachers? and probably tons of other questions. Tbh i was never left behind so they never knew or asked what happens to kids left behind but they naturally assumed a lady would be there for them. \n\nmy parents are really not chill but im proud of them for that. This incident branded them further in a way lol. _((To begin with - more backstory if anyone wants to read -  they accidentally tried to admit me late to this school n were told no, but my parents called the ministry of education to argue why it's my right to go to that school etc. They then tried to fail me entering (giving me words like apple to spell which was too long for kindergarten kids but i did well that's another story tho) i mention this because my folks already had a reputation with fighting wirh the school. That happened upon entry, then this of me in a dark room, then once again after a school play my folks went to get ice cream for me n got stuck so they were latr in picking me up so the vice principal held my hand by thr gate waiting for them. (I remember this actually! Lol) because he was probably not gonna wanna fight them just in case. To end it, in a secondary grade, my math teacher was a bit of a bully. She thought she could bully.my folks too when they came for a parent teacher meeting. Instead she met their wrath \"how dare you speak to our child like this, destroying her self esteem at such a vulnerable age\" etc ((long story short she would be mean to us kids calling me a duffer/dumb kid my grades fell that one year from A to F.)) After that incident they took me out of that school and enrolled me in a nicer one.))_\n\nAfter this my mum said many parents called to thank them, and teachers did too. My parents asked why the hell no one else ever made a complaint? They said they did but they weren't taken seriously or were shut down saying the men would never touch them, how could anyone accuse them etc.. but the truth is that immigrants were not taken very seriously n locals in that country are treated with a bit more oompf. Most other parents were afraid they'd be deported or fined for making fusses and in general were timid. They dont often speak up. Still my folks found that ridiculous. \n\nAfter this, female villagers were employed as like nannies to assist kids after school and i remember they would also take us to the toilets to pee etc.\n\nHonestly - idk if something happened to me or not. I had once asked my mom after she shared this story again in conversation. \"But did anything happen??\" She insisted no, nothing did. My dad said they just picked me up onto the table so they were sure i was okay n i seemed fine in behaviour.\nBut if im totally honest, idk. I have always felt like i was ... Assaulted? At some point in my youth. but i cant be sure n there's no way to find out. so.. Idk.\n\n\nSorry its really long. I type like i speak.",

They might view their family unit as more of an asset, something they own or protect, rather than other autonomous humans. If someone is indifferent or neglectful to other things they own, like a car, piece of technology, or or other object, they aren't very concerned when it's in bad shape, but do miss it when it's finally broken or gone. If they view their own family more as \"their property,\" I bet the members of that family would get the same neglectful treatment. \n\nI'm just speculating based on my own personal experiences with my father and how he treated my mother and I when I was just a baby. I got 13 reoccurring ear infections and high fevers but he would angrily insist that my mother did not need to contact the hospital and threw a fit when she did. Something about it not being necessary (She luckily did each and every time, and the doctors said if this continued, I would get tubes in my ears and possible brain damage from all the fevers). I've come to this as a possible conclusion why some men are neglectful to family members or their wives after tying to rationalize with why my own father did not care to actively seek medical treatment for me, his own baby, but intensely grieve over a previous miscarriage. He was determined and wanted a family unit and was super happy upon finding out I was going to be born, but was not there for the birth (on purpose, premeditated) and was seldom involved in my life.\n\nThe way I see it, I think he and other men like him wanted to have their own families, but view the concept of a family more like accessories to HIS life rather than a connection to other lives. Kind of like \"main character syndrome.\" We are just his side characters, and our quality of life is only valuable as his \"plot development.\" We probably observe these characteristics more in men, be it unintentionally because of the way they grew up in a society that does not view women's lives to be just as valuable as men's lives, or maliciously cause they're just an asshole.",
