Like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK? \n\nDo people actually think this is funny? Do you think it‚Äôs fucking funny that women, who were already wary of men, are now fucking terrified of them?? \n\nDo these men not care about their mothers? Their grandmothers, sisters, aunts, nieces? Their DAUGHTERS??\n\nFuck (not in the way they‚Äôd like you to) every man who has said this, thought about saying this and is thinking about acting on this. \n\nYou will NEVER be entitled to a woman‚Äôs body. EVER.\n\nEdit: I used twitter as an example because that is where I personally saw the comment where men were bragging about having ownership over a woman‚Äôs body. If you read the many comments below you will see that these comments are NOT only being said online, they are being said to women in the real world too. \n\nSo to all those people suggesting that women should ‚Äúdelete their social media accounts‚Äù or just simply ‚Äúignore the trolling‚Äù please do give suggestions on how to do that in real life situations as-well.",

Making doctor appointments. They base their entire sense of identity and self worth on women. \n\nI suggest women stop providing these things. \n\nWhat this society lacks, and has since the ‚Äò80s, is any sense of solidarity.

You should also take a gun safety course, learn how to store, disassemble, and clean your firearm, and do frequent training at a shooting range so you get comfortable using your new friend.  When you pick up that firearm during an emergency when you need to defend yourself, that firearm should feel like an extension of yourself, and therefore using it should feel natural.  It takes work and time to get to that point.\n\n***A gun is a good thing in the right hands, but in untrained hands, it can be more of a threat to you than it is to the other person***.  You can't just get a firearm, put it wherever until you need it, and use it as an empty threat.  That kind of mentality is likely to get you traumatized or killed!  Training, muscle memory, and familiarity are all crucial to gun ownership.  If you take out that gun to confront a threat, and you are unsure of that firearm/are hesitant/aren't accurate in your aim, then it becomes easy for that other person to get close, get it out of your hands, and use it against you.  Yeah, in that situation, you're screwed and you have yourself to blame for it.  Make sure you are trained to use that firearm.\n\n***The first rule of using a firearm is to never, ever point it at anything you aren't prepared to shoot.***  So if you're unsure if you mean it when you point that muzzle, I would recommend not pointing it at all and keeping it hidden.  \n\nLastly, especially if you're newer to firearm ownership and your aim might not be perfect yet, you might consider getting a good laser sight on your firearm.  Even as a seasoned gun owner, I love those things.  They can be pricey, but that price is justified, especially in a situation where you have to both be quick and make very, very sure that you  will put that bullet where it needs to be.  \n\nStay safe out there, and remember:  a neutralized threat, including the trauma of dealing with seeing the blood and gore, is totally more preferable to being defenseless in the face of that threat.  We are NOT powerless.  And it's not illegal to defend ourselves (yet).  If they take away one choice, give them a choice of your making:  walk away or die.",

I was raped as a child and carried that with me my whole dann life, and yes even if I‚Äôm privileged this is what we‚Äôre facing. Globally. Look at Afghan women. Look at Indian women. South Korean women. Yeah I‚Äôm lucky, but it could just be a matter of fucking time.\n\nI want a child with him, he with me, we both want a family. We‚Äôve been through a lot individually and together and he‚Äôs the only person I could ever imagine having a child with.

I‚Äôm just extremely tired and done with having empathy, resiliency, looking at men with human eyes and a human heart.
