I went downstairs to find him shelling pistachios into 2 small snack-sized containers. At the time, I was running a dementia unit at a nursing home and one of my little ladies would sit with me and inevitably eat all of my snacks. This man was sitting there shelling pistachios at 2am - one snack pack for me and one for my little lady who ate my snacks and loved pistachios. That's one of the moments I knew - there were many others, but I'll never forget that image of him sitting at the table singing some song quietly to himself, shelling pistachios for me and my sweetest little lady.",

My partner went to town on a Sunday morning and brought us back bologna/egg/cheese biscuits. It was AMAZING. I was sitting on the couch with my feet up on an ottoman, I sneezed HARD and POOPED RIGHT THROUGH THE SPACE BETWEEN THE SEAT AND THE BACK. I have no idea why my gown wasn‚Äôt under my butt but when I bent over with the sneeze it was the perfect trajectory to go between and hit the fricken wall behind the couch. \n\nI cried and cried. I stood in the shower and cried. I laid on the bed and cried. He cleaned everything and apologized (APOLOGIZED!!!) for getting food my tummy didn‚Äôt like. He finally laid down with me and I stopped crying long enough to tell him I‚Äôd pooped myself so many times I‚Äôd thrown away 1/2 of my undies and I was just glad he had no idea until today. At which point he told me he had been cleaning up little poop drops for 2 weeks but didn‚Äôt want to embarrass me by saying anything. Then he offered to poop in the floor if it would make me feel better about myself. \n\n\nI can‚Äôt let this one go. He‚Äôs a keeper.",
