  "selftext": "Update: THANK YOU all for the love and support sent my way. I wanted to personally thank each and everyone but it got so overwhelming and I read some terrible things, so I decided to just post this update. I really appreciate everyone’s kindness during this time. I wrote this at 4 am after not sleeping for idk how many days and when I reread this it feels like it was written by someone other than myself. But that’s what each moment feels like, like I’m someone different each moment of the day. I really appreciate everyone, as for donations and trying to send me things, I truly have been blessed with a wonderful community and family and do not have a need. Many people shared how reading this is why they decided to stay. Thats all I want out of this, to make sure no other mother, father, family or friend has to feel this pain because it really sucks. Thank you kind people of Reddit. 🤍 \n\n\n\nThe week, August 25th - August 30th of 2024 was the craziest week of my life.\n\nI am the director of nursing over a small nursing home and my week started with a state reportable incident due to a resident having a fall with a major injury. Her fucking femur looked like an X. I’m not even kidding. She fell out of her wheelchair the evening of August 24th and upon assessment of my charge nurse everything seemed fine… well 2 pm the next day I pass by her and noticed her right leg was completely inverted and was not normal. I did a further assessment by trying to do range of motion when all I hear is crinkling… like one of those baby toys with the crinkly sounding paper. I stabilize the leg and I call for stat xray and her femur is literally an X. Idk how her bladder was not penetrated and I didn’t know I had the dumbest floor staff who never noticed something was wrong all day! Literally 3 shifts went by and nobody noticed!\n\nTuesday, my therapy directors father committed suicide so she had to leave to Florida right away. So now we have to figure out therapists to come in a cover her. \n\nWednesday was nursing home fight club between two gentlemen. One hit the other with a cane, so the other lunged and tackled man with cane and started throwing punches. Staff broke it up instantly but holy heck man, like I said dumb staff, so when they break it up my CNA accidentally booty bumped the man swinging causing him to fall straight back, flat on his back. So now I have my 2nd state reportable incident for the week. This same day, I had another resident fall straight on her face and started acting funny, so we ship her out to the hospital. Followed by my night at home, I started a small grease fire in my oven, burning my hand and 4 of my fingers. I put the fire out miraculously and am trying to treat my burned hand when I hear screaming. My 9 year old son got stung by a scorpion that was in our couch. Apparently another family of 4 was living under the couch… \nThursday I had staff call in all day, so I was left to work 16 hour shift that day…. I came home at 10:30 Thursday night and my mom had the boys and my daughter at the house. My daughter wasn’t feeling well all week and had been throwing up and tired from softball all weekend long and played 2 games 8:30 pm Tuesday night. She didn’t go to school Wednesday - Friday. I just thought she was worn out… well that Thursday night I was also worn out and went to bed shortly after getting home and tucking my boys in. My mom said my daughter had been sleeping since 8:30 pm. Well about 2:10 AM Friday morning I wake up to a text from my daughter saying “mom I just threw up replied “Ok” and went back to sleep. Every other time I would check on her, but since she texted me and I was tired I didn’t and I am sick with regret. I saw her in the morning, she was still feeling sick so I told her she could stay home from school. Friday at work I thought I’d get off early since I worked until 10 the night prior, but that same resident who fell on her face suddenly went unresponsive at 3 pm. I could barely feel her pulse so I start working on her. I was able to get her back, but that caused me to stay at work later so I didn’t leave until about 4:40 pm, then went and got my 2 year old from daycare and headed home. I had texted my daughter that day at 9:30 AM and got a response back at 11:30 AM. She said she was feeling a lot better than the night before. Great! She was supposed to go to a friend’s house Friday night so I tried calling her at 3:55 PM to check on her to see if this was still the plan, but no answer. I assumed she was asleep. My mom dropped off my 9 year old son off at about 5 PM, I told her that was fine my daughter was home and I’d be home in like 15minutes. My mom ALWAYS goes into my house to check on the kids, but this day she did not as she was in a hurry. I get home about 5:15 and say hi to the 9 year old, I get the 2 year old out and in the house. We let out the puppy, I set my stuff down and I go to check on my daughter. I didn’t see her in her bed. Weird. I start yelling her name and looking for her. I look everywhere. In the bathroom, the boys room, my room, in the kitchen, outside. I’m tracking her phone, it says she is here but I can’t find her anywhere. So I go back into her room and turn on the light. I look in her first closet and nothing. When I step back and peek into the second closet I see her standing funny with her back towards me and I say “Girl, quit fucking with me” as I flip on her closet light.. she was not fucking with me at all. The first thing I noticed was her hands, they were mottled. She had wet her pants. Her neck was black from where the curling iron cord was. I realize wtf is going on and I immediately start screaming “oh my fucking god, oh my fucking god, oh my fucking god” and call 911. I pulled her down and start CPR. My first time to perform CPR on a child. My first time performing CPR was on MY child. I have been a hospice nurse for 2 years before taking my DON job… I knew when I saw her that she had been gone for over an hour… but I knew I still had to do CPR. My 9 year old came in when I was yelling and saw me pull her down. My 2 year old came in there and was playing with her things on the ground beside me while I’m doing CPR and I just yell “GET OUT OF HERE GET OUT OF HERE NOW!” He wanders out after idk how long. The police and ambulance arrived at my house 3 minutes after I called. They take over and remove me from the room and start asking questions. I tell them what I know. They take her out into the ambulance. And he asks about her phone… we start looking and I pull her blanket off her bed and oh my god I see soooo many empty bottles of pills and wrappers. She tried taking a bunch of Azos, mobic, and tamiflu, and multiple packs and bottles of Benadryl. Oh my god man. The police officer told me to stop touching things bc it’s a crime scene. I stopped and walked out of the room. I told him her phone is probably in her pocket… and it was. I go to the hospital where they continue to work on her for an hour, but they weren’t able to bring her back... But I knew When I found her, I still begged God the entire way to the hospital to save my baby. but I knew I was just wishing. My house was ceased and being investigated until 10:30 pm Friday night when I could finally go inside and grab clothes for myself and my kids and went straight to my parents house where we’ve been since then. \n\nOne thing that literally makes my heart sink into my stomach is that she could have stood up at any point… she could have stood up if she changed her mind after trying to hang herself, but she didn’t… \n\nThis is a kid who I could trust with my life. She told me everything. We were so close. She was soo happy, man. Literally the happiest person, the most beautiful child, she was a cheerleader, she played on 2 softball teams, she was outgoing and hilarious and so loved by literally anyone and everyone. She never said she was depressed or that she was sad. She never said she was under too much pressure. She never acted out. She never said anything. We had the best day together that Sunday the 24th. But she did say something, she played “call your mom” by Noah Kahan and said she wanted that song played at her funeral and that I have to live longer than her so I can make sure that happens. I said “okay crazy, whatever you want.” And never really thought about it again until this happened. But that same day we were planning our trip to Nashville for her birthday. \n\nI am just so heart broken, man. I had her when I was 14 years old. She was my best friend. We grew up together and were so close to each other. I’ve worked my ass off to make sure she could have and do everything she wanted and she did. I made sure to make her feel loved and always cared for. She was literally the best kid. And I know all parents say that, but she was man. She loved everyone and made sure everyone felt loved and special, but the last 3 days of her life she was lonely and sad and suffering from whatever was paining her, and she was all by herself. I hate that man. I hate that I just said “OK”. I hate that I didn’t make her go to my parents when she was sick bc she wanted to be at home in her own bed. I hate that I had to work late the night before. I hate that I didn’t get off early Friday like I was supposed to. I fucking hate this so much. I hate all the sympathy I am getting. I hate that people are awkward around me now. I hate that all I see is suicide prevention with her picture, or name, or her softball number posted all over social media. I hate this. I fucking hate this. I hate that I didn’t know she was suffering. I hate that I wasn’t there for her when she needed me. I hate that she left me and idk why. All she said in her note to me was how proud she is of me and that I’m strong and she is sorry she couldn’t be strong like me and take it anymore. I hate thinking about a world without Sophie. I just hate this. And I can’t sleep because all I do is think how much I’m going to miss her laugh and her sweet, sweet heart. She made everything better. Why did she think this was for the better? I know I can’t keep pondering the why bc it will drive me crazy. I know I can’t keep wishing I did something different. I know nothing will bring her back. I know. And I’m going to be okay. I know she isn’t hurting anymore. I will find a way to live with this. I know I have two boys to live on for. I know there isn’t anything anyone can say. I know she is an angel. I’ve heard it all already and I’m not here for any of that. I seriously just needed to write this out and get it off my chest bc it fucking sucks. I’m really good at being there for people when their loved one is passing away or has passed away, I just never thought it would be me on this side of it. It fucking sucks, man.\n\nJust please anyone who is struggling with suicidal thoughts please reach out to someone, anyone. Call or text 988 if you’re in the USA. Call your mom. Fuck, call me! Idk. Just know that so many people will miss you. Nothing lasts forever except death. :( ",

Why was any of that nursing home stuff relevant to your kid passing away? Why wasn't this whole thing focused entirely on your baby girl as it should've been. Either this is a troll post, or you played a part in her passing. Not trying to be an asshole but ive been a correctional officer and have had an inmate in holding act similar just to find out after their court case they really did do that awful thing to their own child. Everyone called me a dick back then for calling it how I see it while everyone else felt sympathy and pity for the person I, on the other hand, felt off about it, and it turned out I was right. Hopefully, I'm wrong this time, and this is just your way of grieving, which, if that is the case, you have my deepest apologies for my insensitive comment & I deserve any backlash or downvotes I get for posting this comment.

Then they get tired, deep tired, of not knowing what to do. They start to just want to be free, and  convince themselves other people would be happier without them. This was me once.

So I really apologise if I come off as insensitive because that's not at all what I'm trying to convey.\n\n\nYou just need to keep moving forward, I don't know if you're a believer of God or anything, but, I sat for a minute in silent prayer to ask him to watch over you, your children and to protect your daughter in the afterlife. I know from experience this will really get you down, but, it's what we make of these horrors in our lives that make us who we become.\n\n\nProcess your grief and dive into your hobbies if you have any notable ones, it can serve as some kind of diversion from all the chaos admist the grief and your life. Maybe dive into your faith if you have anything, it can be comforting as much as it is destroying, but I've heard (can't speak for myself) that religion does help people with their grief, even if it's only a little.\n\n\n\nI know this is basically me becoming preachy and (admittedly, there's a reason why they're looked down on), but the main takeaway from this reply is.\n\n\nKeep going.

Ive struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past, infact a lot through my childhood and growing up, and even when tryingnto reach out i still had nobody to talk to about it… fuck, i have no idea how i managed to get through it, literally all by myself. Not 1 single person to confide in, to talk to about it, to help me through it, to convince me not to do it, to lead me down a different path. Every day being attacked from parents, siblings, friends (very few), teachers, all the other kids, literally nothing in the world to stop me from going through with it… except for 1 thing. My parents got a dog, and that dog became my best friend. And im not going to talk about it because it will get me upset but man… she was special. I dont think people realise the power our furry friends can have. Its on a different level man. I did things where i can honestly say to you right now i should be dead, God and my dog got me through those times because there wasnt a single person in the world who would even remotely understand. \n\nWhy am i saying all this? Well its to tell you not to be hard on yourself for not knowing there was something wrong… i know its easier said then done and wont be easy especially now, and i also know a lot of people will say “the signs are always there”… no they are not. To everyone at the time, i was the happiest boy, always laughing and joking, always had a smile on my face, i did my absolute best to cover up the pain and suffering i had inside, and i became damn good at it. Everyone else’s needs were above my own and i became a 2nd thought to myself. Everyone else was number 1 to me. Unless you have been that person going through it, for years and years and years and have gone through every emotional state at that time, you just dont know what its like. Its not as easy as saying “the signs are there” - they arent. You sound like a decent parent to me, hard working, your job is focused on helping others, much like my mum (shes a nurse), you sound like a good person, so dont hate yourself, and dont think it was anything you did, read the words your daughter left you, you obviously meant a lot to her, as my mum does to me.

I'm good now but I will say this.  I want to bother no one with my depression. I know I'm most likely overreacting so it's my burden and mine alone. I now see that as a problem though.  I've made YouTube videos about what depression is like. Almost no one watch them but that's fine.  People with depression need to be more open about it instead of hiding it with humor until it's too much then we commit suicide.\n\nShe was probably struggling for years but didn't want to bother anyone with her \"drama\". This is the end result. People with depression need to be more open. It's hard, but it's ok to push through difficult situations. Sorry for your loss op.",

That night that she said she was sick in her room you were so tired and overworked you couldn’t check on her. It’s just so sad. We are forced as a society to work our lives away and those who end up getting into shitty situations like having kids as teenagers get hit like fucking semis and unless you have a solid financial background there is SO little you can do about it. Money is the worst thing we’ve ever invented as a society because majority of us spend our lives away for it, and the omega rich just sit back and do nothing. This just became another classic example of why capitalism sucks.

That kid never got to be a kid.\n2) Kid left note saying something like, “sorry you’re strong I’m not”, points more to comparing to adult expectations & duties, burnt under the pressure.\n3) Kid needed adult attention as though she is just another kid, even if she was mature & responsible & top of the class. \n4) OP is grieving & doesn’t recognize that the suicidal feelings are not just from last 4 days, or maybe they just do not know this concept. Suicidal ideation starts sometimes years in advance, it is passive & silent, until one day it can (not always) become active if needs continue to be unmet. It is usually a build up.\n\n\nI feel bad for OP, no one should have to lose their child, but can see clear signs that no, kid wasn’t randomly “irrational” as one post said, maybe adults were “irrational” and put too much pressure on the kid. If nothing at all, hope it makes the expectations for other kids more reasonable. Ofc, I don’t know the full lived story, but from snippets - those 4 points do stand out.",

Then you have the 3 friends i can ever remember having… everyone else around me at that time whether it was kids at school in my year or different years both above and below who all piled on and just would not stop for even a moment… maybe you are right, because whilst i think to myself “no there were no warning signs im sure of it”, at the same time i also think there is no possible way someone could endure that much from literally every direction and not a single person take a step back and think “shit are we going too far?” Or “maybe we should lay off for a second because surely he will break soon if he hasnt already” - like you’d have to be (apologies for using this phrase but) mentally insane to think that someone could endure everything i did and not have some form of mental breakdown through it? Like there would have to be something physically wrong with you, in my mind. Sorry for being so bold and using these words but this is the first time im expressing my thoughts about this openly… and now as an adult, its even more shocking to me that im talking about people who were adults… who were older at the time then i am now… you know? That seems crazy to me! \n\nBut yeh i have to be ok with it. Dont get me wrong there are wounds that are still there (if you cant tell 😅), but why let this stuff rule my life? Why focus on it? Like, what would be the point? At some point you have to step back and say to yourself like… what do you want to get out of it ultimately? What do you want your end goal to be? Everyone to apologise? - Well thats never going to happen. Everyone to feel guilty? - What does that achieve? And if someone did say sorry, would that be enough to make you feel ok? And why would it? You just have to let it go. If you’re lucky you have 80 years on this planet, give or take, right, so why would you want to waste any of it with hate in your heart? You’re a better and stronger person because you can walk away from all of that stuff, still standing. \nI truly believe i am fearless, i dont fear anything and im not saying that to try and sound big or anything but ive reached that point where im like… if i can live through all of that stuff and be standing here without any need for any justification or for it even to be acknowledged, no one to even accept it happened, fuck… what in the hell could possibly scare me at this point?! Because that was a living hell, a living nightmare, constantly, for the best part of 18+ years. Shit man… fuck. \n\nThe only other thing id say is… all this stuff is other people trying to bring you down, why give them that control over you? Dont ever let someone have that kind of power over you. They dont deserve it\n\nIm sorry you had to go through what you did, truly, i dont know what it is you went through and will never truly understand, but i get it. You are strong. And more importantly you matter!",

That said, I'm not going to respond after this - not after days.  Re: \"sharing a similar experience\".  You're right, this is not gatekeeping.  Re: \"Welcome to the reality of single moms.\"  This is gatekeeping.  You may not have given this statement a second thought because of biases, but it is gatekeeping.  THE reality of single moms is not something you can speak to, because you are one person and because the experience of single moms is diverse.  You can therefore not stand at the door and welcome, as you say,  people to single motherhood - you are not the authority, so don't presume to be.  Some children of single parents were not neglected, and also some single mothers would strongly disagree  that neglecting their children is an option for them.  Also, don't ask me if I know the definition of gatekeeping if you don't know the meaning of the words you post.  Finally, don't overinflate the importance or universality of your experience.  Your anecdote and your opinion should stand on its own. \n\nOnce again, you bring up that people have kids in circumstances that are not good, and you've already defended this practice.  I hear you - it happens, it happened to you,  and you excuse it.  There have been many cases, I hope you'll agree, throughout history where our reality has been less than optimal for marginalized or voiceless groups like children.  Things did not improve by people saying \"well it happens\" or \"it happened to me, and I found a way to cope, so stop pointing out the problem at inconvenient times\".  Pointing out that OP made bad choices, expressing grief over the death of a child, and pointing out alternative routes is my opinion, and it is just as valid as yours.  Speaking of which, re: \"it doesn't mean you get to pass judgement on someone else's grief\", don't tell me that I can't  judge what I see.  Besides that, I never ever judged her grief specifically because I'm not concerned with it.  I commented on her choices and my sadness over what's happened to the children.  On that front, I think you have me confused with another post.  You may be unaware that you yourself are passing judgement, which is an assessment of good or bad, on her grief if you validate it.  Would it be valid for someone, who's been presented the same post as you,  to say you don't get to pass judgement?  Rhetorical question.",
