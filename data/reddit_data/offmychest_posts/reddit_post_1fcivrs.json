  "selftext": "Update: THANK YOU all for the love and support sent my way. I wanted to personally thank each and everyone but it got so overwhelming and I read some terrible things, so I decided to just post this update. I really appreciate everyone‚Äôs kindness during this time. I wrote this at 4 am after not sleeping for idk how many days and when I reread this it feels like it was written by someone other than myself. But that‚Äôs what each moment feels like, like I‚Äôm someone different each moment of the day. I really appreciate everyone, as for donations and trying to send me things, I truly have been blessed with a wonderful community and family and do not have a need. Many people shared how reading this is why they decided to stay. Thats all I want out of this, to make sure no other mother, father, family or friend has to feel this pain because it really sucks. Thank you kind people of Reddit. ü§ç \n\n\n\nThe week, August 25th - August 30th of 2024 was the craziest week of my life.\n\nI am the director of nursing over a small nursing home and my week started with a state reportable incident due to a resident having a fall with a major injury. Her fucking femur looked like an X. I‚Äôm not even kidding. She fell out of her wheelchair the evening of August 24th and upon assessment of my charge nurse everything seemed fine‚Ä¶ well 2 pm the next day I pass by her and noticed her right leg was completely inverted and was not normal. I did a further assessment by trying to do range of motion when all I hear is crinkling‚Ä¶ like one of those baby toys with the crinkly sounding paper. I stabilize the leg and I call for stat xray and her femur is literally an X. Idk how her bladder was not penetrated and I didn‚Äôt know I had the dumbest floor staff who never noticed something was wrong all day! Literally 3 shifts went by and nobody noticed!\n\nTuesday, my therapy directors father committed suicide so she had to leave to Florida right away. So now we have to figure out therapists to come in a cover her. \n\nWednesday was nursing home fight club between two gentlemen. One hit the other with a cane, so the other lunged and tackled man with cane and started throwing punches. Staff broke it up instantly but holy heck man, like I said dumb staff, so when they break it up my CNA accidentally booty bumped the man swinging causing him to fall straight back, flat on his back. So now I have my 2nd state reportable incident for the week. This same day, I had another resident fall straight on her face and started acting funny, so we ship her out to the hospital. Followed by my night at home, I started a small grease fire in my oven, burning my hand and 4 of my fingers. I put the fire out miraculously and am trying to treat my burned hand when I hear screaming. My 9 year old son got stung by a scorpion that was in our couch. Apparently another family of 4 was living under the couch‚Ä¶ \nThursday I had staff call in all day, so I was left to work 16 hour shift that day‚Ä¶. I came home at 10:30 Thursday night and my mom had the boys and my daughter at the house. My daughter wasn‚Äôt feeling well all week and had been throwing up and tired from softball all weekend long and played 2 games 8:30 pm Tuesday night. She didn‚Äôt go to school Wednesday - Friday. I just thought she was worn out‚Ä¶ well that Thursday night I was also worn out and went to bed shortly after getting home and tucking my boys in. My mom said my daughter had been sleeping since 8:30 pm. Well about 2:10 AM Friday morning I wake up to a text from my daughter saying ‚Äúmom I just threw up replied ‚ÄúOk‚Äù and went back to sleep. Every other time I would check on her, but since she texted me and I was tired I didn‚Äôt and I am sick with regret. I saw her in the morning, she was still feeling sick so I told her she could stay home from school. Friday at work I thought I‚Äôd get off early since I worked until 10 the night prior, but that same resident who fell on her face suddenly went unresponsive at 3 pm. I could barely feel her pulse so I start working on her. I was able to get her back, but that caused me to stay at work later so I didn‚Äôt leave until about 4:40 pm, then went and got my 2 year old from daycare and headed home. I had texted my daughter that day at 9:30 AM and got a response back at 11:30 AM. She said she was feeling a lot better than the night before. Great! She was supposed to go to a friend‚Äôs house Friday night so I tried calling her at 3:55 PM to check on her to see if this was still the plan, but no answer. I assumed she was asleep. My mom dropped off my 9 year old son off at about 5 PM, I told her that was fine my daughter was home and I‚Äôd be home in like 15minutes. My mom ALWAYS goes into my house to check on the kids, but this day she did not as she was in a hurry. I get home about 5:15 and say hi to the 9 year old, I get the 2 year old out and in the house. We let out the puppy, I set my stuff down and I go to check on my daughter. I didn‚Äôt see her in her bed. Weird. I start yelling her name and looking for her. I look everywhere. In the bathroom, the boys room, my room, in the kitchen, outside. I‚Äôm tracking her phone, it says she is here but I can‚Äôt find her anywhere. So I go back into her room and turn on the light. I look in her first closet and nothing. When I step back and peek into the second closet I see her standing funny with her back towards me and I say ‚ÄúGirl, quit fucking with me‚Äù as I flip on her closet light.. she was not fucking with me at all. The first thing I noticed was her hands, they were mottled. She had wet her pants. Her neck was black from where the curling iron cord was. I realize wtf is going on and I immediately start screaming ‚Äúoh my fucking god, oh my fucking god, oh my fucking god‚Äù and call 911. I pulled her down and start CPR. My first time to perform CPR on a child. My first time performing CPR was on MY child. I have been a hospice nurse for 2 years before taking my DON job‚Ä¶ I knew when I saw her that she had been gone for over an hour‚Ä¶ but I knew I still had to do CPR. My 9 year old came in when I was yelling and saw me pull her down. My 2 year old came in there and was playing with her things on the ground beside me while I‚Äôm doing CPR and I just yell ‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE GET OUT OF HERE NOW!‚Äù He wanders out after idk how long. The police and ambulance arrived at my house 3 minutes after I called. They take over and remove me from the room and start asking questions. I tell them what I know. They take her out into the ambulance. And he asks about her phone‚Ä¶ we start looking and I pull her blanket off her bed and oh my god I see soooo many empty bottles of pills and wrappers. She tried taking a bunch of Azos, mobic, and tamiflu, and multiple packs and bottles of Benadryl. Oh my god man. The police officer told me to stop touching things bc it‚Äôs a crime scene. I stopped and walked out of the room. I told him her phone is probably in her pocket‚Ä¶ and it was. I go to the hospital where they continue to work on her for an hour, but they weren‚Äôt able to bring her back... But I knew When I found her, I still begged God the entire way to the hospital to save my baby. but I knew I was just wishing. My house was ceased and being investigated until 10:30 pm Friday night when I could finally go inside and grab clothes for myself and my kids and went straight to my parents house where we‚Äôve been since then. \n\nOne thing that literally makes my heart sink into my stomach is that she could have stood up at any point‚Ä¶ she could have stood up if she changed her mind after trying to hang herself, but she didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ \n\nThis is a kid who I could trust with my life. She told me everything. We were so close. She was soo happy, man. Literally the happiest person, the most beautiful child, she was a cheerleader, she played on 2 softball teams, she was outgoing and hilarious and so loved by literally anyone and everyone. She never said she was depressed or that she was sad. She never said she was under too much pressure. She never acted out. She never said anything. We had the best day together that Sunday the 24th. But she did say something, she played ‚Äúcall your mom‚Äù by Noah Kahan and said she wanted that song played at her funeral and that I have to live longer than her so I can make sure that happens. I said ‚Äúokay crazy, whatever you want.‚Äù And never really thought about it again until this happened. But that same day we were planning our trip to Nashville for her birthday. \n\nI am just so heart broken, man. I had her when I was 14 years old. She was my best friend. We grew up together and were so close to each other. I‚Äôve worked my ass off to make sure she could have and do everything she wanted and she did. I made sure to make her feel loved and always cared for. She was literally the best kid. And I know all parents say that, but she was man. She loved everyone and made sure everyone felt loved and special, but the last 3 days of her life she was lonely and sad and suffering from whatever was paining her, and she was all by herself. I hate that man. I hate that I just said ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. I hate that I didn‚Äôt make her go to my parents when she was sick bc she wanted to be at home in her own bed. I hate that I had to work late the night before. I hate that I didn‚Äôt get off early Friday like I was supposed to. I fucking hate this so much. I hate all the sympathy I am getting. I hate that people are awkward around me now. I hate that all I see is suicide prevention with her picture, or name, or her softball number posted all over social media. I hate this. I fucking hate this. I hate that I didn‚Äôt know she was suffering. I hate that I wasn‚Äôt there for her when she needed me. I hate that she left me and idk why. All she said in her note to me was how proud she is of me and that I‚Äôm strong and she is sorry she couldn‚Äôt be strong like me and take it anymore. I hate thinking about a world without Sophie. I just hate this. And I can‚Äôt sleep because all I do is think how much I‚Äôm going to miss her laugh and her sweet, sweet heart. She made everything better. Why did she think this was for the better? I know I can‚Äôt keep pondering the why bc it will drive me crazy. I know I can‚Äôt keep wishing I did something different. I know nothing will bring her back. I know. And I‚Äôm going to be okay. I know she isn‚Äôt hurting anymore. I will find a way to live with this. I know I have two boys to live on for. I know there isn‚Äôt anything anyone can say. I know she is an angel. I‚Äôve heard it all already and I‚Äôm not here for any of that. I seriously just needed to write this out and get it off my chest bc it fucking sucks. I‚Äôm really good at being there for people when their loved one is passing away or has passed away, I just never thought it would be me on this side of it. It fucking sucks, man.\n\nJust please anyone who is struggling with suicidal thoughts please reach out to someone, anyone. Call or text 988 if you‚Äôre in the USA. Call your mom. Fuck, call me! Idk. Just know that so many people will miss you. Nothing lasts forever except death. :( ",

Either this is a troll post, or you played a part in her passing. Not trying to be an asshole but ive been a correctional officer and have had an inmate in holding act similar just to find out after their court case they really did do that awful thing to their own child. Everyone called me a dick back then for calling it how I see it while everyone else felt sympathy and pity for the person I, on the other hand, felt off about it, and it turned out I was right.

Not 1 single person to confide in, to talk to about it, to help me through it, to convince me not to do it, to lead me down a different path. Every day being attacked from parents, siblings, friends (very few), teachers, all the other kids, literally nothing in the world to stop me from going through with it‚Ä¶ except for 1 thing. My parents got a dog, and that dog became my best friend. And im not going to talk about it because it will get me upset but man‚Ä¶ she was special. I dont think people realise the power our furry friends can have. Its on a different level man. I did things where i can honestly say to you right now i should be dead, God and my dog got me through those times because there wasnt a single person in the world who would even remotely understand. \n\nWhy am i saying all this? Well its to tell you not to be hard on yourself for not knowing there was something wrong‚Ä¶ i know its easier said then done and wont be easy especially now, and i also know a lot of people will say ‚Äúthe signs are always there‚Äù‚Ä¶ no they are not. To everyone at the time, i was the happiest boy, always laughing and joking, always had a smile on my face, i did my absolute best to cover up the pain and suffering i had inside, and i became damn good at it. Everyone else‚Äôs needs were above my own and i became a 2nd thought to myself. Everyone else was number 1 to me. Unless you have been that person going through it, for years and years and years and have gone through every emotional state at that time, you just dont know what its like. Its not as easy as saying ‚Äúthe signs are there‚Äù - they arent. You sound like a decent parent to me, hard working, your job is focused on helping others, much like my mum (shes a nurse), you sound like a good person, so dont hate yourself, and dont think it was anything you did, read the words your daughter left you, you obviously meant a lot to her, as my mum does to me.

And saying it's a stressful week, when your child committed suicide, I don't think I'd even remember what happened at work or compare/add that to the stress of losing a child. Nothing else would matter or be stressful once your child is gone. \n\nIf you said it was the worst week because your child died, it's totally understandable, but adding more info about what happened with a patient at work than talking about your child is odd to me. Coming from someone who has worked in hospitals and I now work with hundreds of long-term care facilities. These things happen often in SNF/long term care. People die at them VERY often, to the point where most staff are numb to it. \n\nI lost my dad my last semester of college when I was 21, and I didn't think about school / assignments anything for maybe 2 months.

Everyone to apologise? - Well thats never going to happen. Everyone to feel guilty? - What does that achieve? And if someone did say sorry, would that be enough to make you feel ok? And why would it? You just have to let it go. If you‚Äôre lucky you have 80 years on this planet, give or take, right, so why would you want to waste any of it with hate in your heart? You‚Äôre a better and stronger person because you can walk away from all of that stuff, still standing. \nI truly believe i am fearless, i dont fear anything and im not saying that to try and sound big or anything but ive reached that point where im like‚Ä¶ if i can live through all of that stuff and be standing here without any need for any justification or for it even to be acknowledged, no one to even accept it happened, fuck‚Ä¶ what in the hell could possibly scare me at this point?! Because that was a living hell, a living nightmare, constantly, for the best part of 18+ years. Shit man‚Ä¶ fuck. \n\nThe only other thing id say is‚Ä¶ all this stuff is other people trying to bring you down, why give them that control over you? Dont ever let someone have that kind of power over you. They dont deserve it\n\nIm sorry you had to go through what you did, truly, i dont know what it is you went through and will never truly understand, but i get it. You are strong.

That said, I'm not going to respond after this - not after days.  Re: \"sharing a similar experience\".  You're right, this is not gatekeeping.  Re: \"Welcome to the reality of single moms.\"  This is gatekeeping.  You may not have given this statement a second thought because of biases, but it is gatekeeping.  THE reality of single moms is not something you can speak to, because you are one person and because the experience of single moms is diverse.  You can therefore not stand at the door and welcome, as you say,  people to single motherhood - you are not the authority, so don't presume to be.  Some children of single parents were not neglected, and also some single mothers would strongly disagree  that neglecting their children is an option for them.  Also, don't ask me if I know the definition of gatekeeping if you don't know the meaning of the words you post.  Finally, don't overinflate the importance or universality of your experience.  Your anecdote and your opinion should stand on its own. \n\nOnce again, you bring up that people have kids in circumstances that are not good, and you've already defended this practice.  I hear you - it happens, it happened to you,  and you excuse it.  There have been many cases, I hope you'll agree, throughout history where our reality has been less than optimal for marginalized or voiceless groups like children.  Things did not improve by people saying \"well it happens\" or \"it happened to me, and I found a way to cope, so stop pointing out the problem at inconvenient times\".  Pointing out that OP made bad choices, expressing grief over the death of a child, and pointing out alternative routes is my opinion, and it is just as valid as yours.  Speaking of which, re: \"it doesn't mean you get to pass judgement on someone else's grief\", don't tell me that I can't  judge what I see.  Besides that, I never ever judged her grief specifically because I'm not concerned with it.  I commented on her choices and my sadness over what's happened to the children.  On that front, I think you have me confused with another post.  You may be unaware that you yourself are passing judgement, which is an assessment of good or bad, on her grief if you validate it.  Would it be valid for someone, who's been presented the same post as you,  to say you don't get to pass judgement?  Rhetorical question.",
