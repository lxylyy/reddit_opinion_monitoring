  "selftext": "Throwaway account. My (M42) wife (F45) and I have been together 8 years, married for 5. We  have sex all the damn time. She's incredible. Just the other night, we were in different parts of the house, doing our own things. I was about to head to bed when she came bounding down the stairs in stockings, a garter, and a midriff tank top. \n\nDear God she's the sexiest thing I've ever seen. We immediately went into the bedroom and had incredible sex that ended in a soul rending blowjob. \n\nOur friends are mutual, so it would be weird for me to say these kinds of things to them. I just needed to put this out into the world how much I enjoy this woman. ",

I can't be anything because of a botched surgery so if she has a sister I love to fix her up with someone that deserves better than a disabled POS that does take care of all she can around the house. But I just got out the hospital and I couldn't do it third time my antibiotics are a day late and it's just so ironic that his memories are all wrong. First I chased him around to much now I'm just a worthless cripple. Thanks to two sea , and while diabetes don't help I was told that no one heals good on bottom of foot. Don't hp me getting shit throw in at my face and at me that didn't hit me but it did. But if I say anything I'm lying. I'm just a piece of meat brick me right. I'm tired of being put down because a Dr didn't give me antibiotics ands I came back to.  Foot Dr putting a home in my foot m.ita always about his needs so I hope there is a woman that can do all his work clean cook work and fuck five times a day because I'm not the  right woman for the job.  I did give him sex twice last night but I'm tired and in pain plus my walker did hit my leg but he thinks I'm lying. The more he treats me like this the less I even want it. I'm sick of finding ply to live and being the only loyal one even after he was punching me in the face, but as long as he has some mental disabilities but well I loved him so I stood by him. But I don't give him sex enough   so I'm just over it. His SSI got suspended I HV to get it back or I'd find another hospital to go in for a week. It's sad when u hv to look forward to hospital stay missing your cats because your gonna have to do it even if your leg is burning on fire. I r asked to have it cut off just so I could move better. This isn't because of diabetes as much as it's about soda to him. I still tried once a day. Apparently his libedo is back . He quit methadone went to jail and I begged to have charges dropped. But he didn't want it during a few periods in the past he won't admit to. I never got mad but I mean I can't do it five times a day so if anyone wants a young handsome guy, as long as they don't HV problems fucking that's all that matters to him. Oh weed too. He will pitch in his money he can get more if so done wants to put the effort in. I'm so aged from being yelled at all the time. Like it kinky so . Please don't worry he is a nice guy but he will break things so stones. Just can't deal anymore perfect for a young girl q energy . But let him sleep if he is tired I suggest sleeping when he so we a better to have more time together.  I am completely lost I can't talk to him . I don't want to get yelled at devalued anymore. I'm a cripple I'm going die if this doesn't stop. Of course nothing wrong w him thinking of his needs. Mine lol I'm so t even want to be here anymore is be happy with a bum on the street oof he gave me a flower. I'm being punished for leaving my w, husband. Maybe I shout join a convent my life is over at 49. I could have healed but I get no chance to. So we're can I go to find him a proper woman . ? Please hypersexual between 25-45 please . I. Actually seriousl  I thought I was a good woman, perhaps I was but I'm a rag doll now . He doesn't even know I'm lucky if I make it five years .why did I even fall for Tim this last punch I still have pain it was purple two weeks and I lost most my hearing. I would never date a man again. If I dated at all it be a woman but I just want a friend. I got no family really. And all people like me is cause I get pills. Otherwise I'd never have a phone call. No way and drugs they want him sex. O one ever  wanted mine. Except to break it. I think my late husband I left for being mean drunk was it. . have your laughs. I'm not allowed to cry. I despise people. He wasn't like this when I first met him . I'm so close to getting even w the Drs and I got nothing. Guess what I will be gone to hospital after I fix his check . He have a bed two cats  be good to my cats. I'm just tired from calls and we'll  free  roof . I'm qorhleas",

In fact, we were commuting to work together with another one of our coworkers on the morning of 9/11 (weird, right?). It was a great job that lasted 8 month and we never had to do anything because the courts shut Napster down and they never ended up launching the pay service. \n\n  \nWe dated for about 9 months, there was an instant connection but I was young (19 at the time) and already had two kids (my life was weird) so I messed it up. 15 years later I was freshly divorced and looked her up, found that she was also freshly divorced. I got really stoned one night, not long after that, and mustered the courage to message her. \n\n  \nWe had coffee about a week after that and it was instantaneous. Right when I hugged her, the smell, brought me back to exactly how I felt about her when I was 19. It was one of the most bizarre experiences, it was like getting electrocuted.

His mom, my wife at the time, couldn't handle it and split. She was already one foot out the door anyway. We had only gotten married because she got pregnant and my parents wanted to send me to a boy's home to keep me away from the baby. I did a little research and discovered that I could get a judge in the south to marry us (I was 16 she was 15) and that would make us legally emancipated so my parents couldn't send me away. We went on a clandestine road trip and that was that.   \n  \nShe moved in with someone else (I later found out they had been sleeping together for months already) and I hadn't seen her in about two months when I started my job at Napster and met my current wife. We were wholly separated and I got as far as getting divorce papers going. Her relationship fell apart and she could tell I was getting serious with my new girlfriend so she came back going on and on about wanting to be a \"family\" and this and that. Unfortunately I was feeling pressured by both her and my family (I was talking to my parents again by then) and my own misguided sense of duty. I broke up with my future wife and got back together with my kids' mom. That was probably the biggest mistake of my life, spent the next 15 years in a truly terrible marriage. \n\nBut I got my happy ending anyways.
