  "selftext": "Thank you to everyone who read my first post and offered support. It feels like I‚Äôm living a nightmare. A lot more has happened, so I wanted to post an update.\n\nThe day I posted, they took my sister to the police. She admitted that the ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with my husband began when she was 15. She also said things became physical when she was 16. They had exchanged inappropriate messages and images, and the content on her phone matched everything she told them. My soon to be ex knew she was pregnant. He was arrested at his job earlier today. Last night was the first time in a year that I went to bed and he wasn‚Äôt there. It felt surreal. \n\nMy dad, who is very religious, insists my sister keep the baby. My mom believes she should have the choice to end the pregnancy.\n\nI‚Äôve already contacted a lawyer for the annulment and emphasized that I want no more contact with him. There‚Äôs nothing left to salvage.\n\nEven though my sister has apologized several times, she still believes she‚Äôs in love with him. My family is planning to start family counseling soon. It will be focused on figuring out how to move forward and what kind of relationship, if any, I want to have with my sister. There are no clear answers right now. \n\nThe support I‚Äôve received from people here has helped me feel less alone. Thank you.",

One day, my 14-year-old sister was with me at his house and I fell asleep on the couch. She went upstairs with him and they slept together. He took her virginity. When they came downstairs, she mad it a point to show me the blood on her pants from the situation and gloated that she slept with him. It's been over 20 years and I still vacillate between he groomed her and she knew what she was doing and it did to hurt me. Truth be told, it was a little of both.\n\nMany people will tell you that your sister is 100% a victim and to not be mad with her. She is a victim but she also actively made a choice.

She‚Äôs going to think she‚Äôs in love with him for a long, long time.\n\nI won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but I had a relationship at 17 with a man who told me he was 8 years older than me (he was actually 10-11 years older than me). It was a shorter relationship, but I thought I was in love with him. I didn‚Äôt find out his true age until my mom called the cops when she found out (the detectives met with me once and I didn‚Äôt hear anything until they tested my rape kit years later). It took visiting him once after I‚Äôd turned 18 and lots of therapy to realize that he was actually a very sick man and I wasn‚Äôt in love‚Äîwhat I was experiencing was actually closer to something like Stockholm Syndrome). Sent his sorry ass to jail and the registry in 2019, 7 years later. Haha, loser.\n\nMy point is‚Äîit may take longer because their relationship was longer, but she will eventually realize what really happened. She‚Äôs been groomed by a sexual predator. She needs to be in counseling though, seriously. Like immediately. You also should probably seek out support if you haven‚Äôt already. I‚Äôd highly recommend contacting a victim‚Äôs advocate that you can both speak to as well (the cops/sex crimes detectives should also provide you with this information). VAs provide valuable resources, help empower the victim, and are there for you every step of the way from investigation-prosecution. Your sister may not be into the whole VA thing (she might not see herself as a victim, but as a consenting adult), maybe you can phrase it as asking if she‚Äôll come support you. You‚Äôre both victims here.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry that this is your reality right now. Remember that there will eventually be an end to this entire chapter and your life will start again. You‚Äôll have no doubt learned a lot more lessons from this than you ever asked to, but remember that what you gain will benefit you in the long-run and that what you lose you will heal from.

Predators like that monster are masters at manipulating and finding vulnerabilities right down to playing the long game to get what they want. He played you and your sister. He played everyone who trusted him including your parents. This is what predators do. I‚Äôm not surprised she still loves him, the spell people like him cast is strong. \n\nFamily counseling is a good thing for your sister and parents. They have a lot they need to sort out which includes her being pregnant and what to do about it. Aborting, keeping, and adopting are all hard decisions. \nOne thing to remember is that no matter what they decide about the grooming and your sister‚Äôs pregnancy,  you can decide how you choose to move forward for you. Close contact, low contact, no contact, or anything that you feel that works for you. There are no hard and fast rules. \n\nI suggest that you get your own therapy that is separate from the family therapy. Start there first and remember that you can join in family counseling only when you want to and are ready.",

Although she was groomed by him, and he manipulated her, it's still a huge betrayal from your sister, and she should have known it was wrong. But that's the downside of being groomed, they manipulate them in such a way that literally controls and warps their mind into not really thinking clearly or logically. \nOn one hand she should have known its wrong, but on the other hand she was groomed and manipulated and played on her weakness. \nThe reason why groomers get away with what they do is because they focus on the child's weakness and vulnerability, often the need for love and attention and praise and being made to feel special etc. \n\nEither way, it's understandable you still have difficult emotions surrounding your sisters part in all this. And that will take time to work through in therapy. But whichever way it turns out, whether you manage to work things out and forgive her, or whether you are able to simply be civil around her, or whether you cut her out because it's too difficult for you to be around her and be reminded of what she did, any option is understandable, and its important to do what's best for you and your mental health. \n\nIn regards to her pregnancy, the best solution would be termination. She's still young, she'll be a single parent, hopefully your ex will go to jail, so she may not get child support unless he has a lot of savings etc. Although that will probably go on lawyers. \n\nPlus she needs to realise that baby is going to be a constant reminder for you of what he did. \nAnd she's got to realise people will come to learn the truth eventually, esp when it goes to court etc. Does she want everyone knowing she got pregnant by her sisters husband? And she's still young, it will affect her future. \nI think you should talk to your dad and let him know that this is a hugely different situation to her just getting pregnant young by a 'boyfriend'. She's been groomed by the father, and its a constant reminder of what you husband did, and their relationship behind your back for so long. The baby will be a reminder of how you were betrayed so badly. \nAnd that he can have his opinions, but reality is it would be the best option if she terminated, so you'd appreciate it if he could just not encourage her or pressure her to keep the baby. He doesn't have to encourage termination, but just stay quiet. \n\nAnd speak to your mum for support too, and hopefully she can make your sister see sense. Especially regarding how she'll be a single mother and cost of raising a baby with no help from the father, the stigma she may face from people, and whether your parents would even want to help with the baby etc. \n\nI hope you're getting some individual counselling for yourself, and your ex will stay somewhere else while waiting for his court case, unless he's being kept inside. \n\nI'm so sorry, but I'm glad he's been arrested and there's a lot of evidence against him.
