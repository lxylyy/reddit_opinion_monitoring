Did you sense her getting distant?\n\nI just mentioned this to some guy on Reddit earlier today who was complaining that his girlfriend constantly asks when they will get engaged. He‚Äôs annoyed by this. They‚Äôve been together 7 years! He said he wanted to be with her, but that he wasn‚Äôt ready? I warned him that he‚Äôs getting to the point where she‚Äôs just going to be done and gone. \n\nA little insight to how many women work- It will seem to come out of nowhere. When we get dismissed repeatedly or don‚Äôt feel we are heard or blown off, or feel we have to nag about something that never gets done because something else is always put ahead of it, a little piece of us slowly dies off because we feel we don‚Äôt matter to our partner. Eventually we will start pulling away and detaching ourselves from the relationship and mentally preparing ourself to leave. We won‚Äôt warn you either, we figure if our nagging didn‚Äôt do anything then this will also fall on deaf ears as well. \n\nI actually watched a guy on TikTok explain this very thing to men. He told guys that when a woman stops nagging or not bringing stuff up anymore, and you think the relationship is finally going great because we aren‚Äôt fighting anymore- that‚Äôs when you should be worried. Because that‚Äôs a good sign that we‚Äôre giving up on the relationship. We don‚Äôt care anymore and we won‚Äôt tell you because why bother. And once a woman tells you that they‚Äôre done, it‚Äôs generally too late. That‚Äôs usually when guys like to try and suddenly fix everything all at once but unfortunately, by that point, we‚Äôre ready to walk out the door.        \nThe comment section was full of women agreeing and saying that they were ready to leave their partner and that their partner had no idea. Most said that their partner will most likely be blindsided. That these guys ignore their partners to the point that they don‚Äôt even notice that their partner is mentally checking themselves out of the relationship.",

Deep inside me, i wanted him to propose to see if he really wants me in the long run or if he‚Äôs afraid to lose me but I pretended to believe on his excused and just said yeah you‚Äôre right.\n\nOn 11th year, he was already making hints because at this time, he was earning big but the idea of marriage for me has already died down. I‚Äôve asked myself countless times what wrong with me why does this man don‚Äôt want me to his wife? All these questions made me think of myself as the girl who is not the marrying type.\n\nAnd because the proposal/marriage idea is already out of my system, I don‚Äôt feel any joy about it anymore, not excited I honestly told him if you will propose to me I will say no because I don‚Äôt feel doing it anymore. I told him what I went through to get to that decision.

I had a cousin who did the same thing and proposed after 10 years and they‚Äôre happily married now, but everything has nuance. For them they started dating quite young, and so it was more a matter of finances and maturity for when he proposed. There is a lot of life circumstances that can absolutely explain why it took you 10 years. But, I assume the difference between their situation and yours is communication. For my cousin, they talked about it a lot and both agreed that they want to get married but they wanted to save up to be able to do it properly, and be settled into their respective careers so that planning wouldn‚Äôt be unnecessarily stressful. I can of course only infer, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like you both talked about it much in a way that made you both feel happy. Perhaps you didn‚Äôt talk about it at all and no one really brought it up, or she brought it up and instead of having full length conversations about it you may have dismissed her feelings by saying ‚Äúsoon‚Äù or something to that effect. Maybe it‚Äôs a bit of both where she brought it up a lot years ago but due to your dismissals she stopped bringing it up entirely. But, the bottom line is that the topic of you proposing to her for a long time now, most likely years, was something that she had completely put off the table due to lack of reassurance, and when you did propose, all those years of pent up resentment came back to the surface, and instead of feeling loved and cherished in something that in her mind should make her the happiest girl in the world, she felt nothing like that. I‚Äôm sure you feel like this was a surprise and shock and her reaction was completely unexpected, and you have so many questions, and maybe you‚Äôre starting to feel resentment back to her for not communicating more to you, but that won‚Äôt solve any problems, and that takes the accountability off your shoulders when this is fully your responsibility. She shouldn‚Äôt have to beg you to marry her, she shouldn‚Äôt have to ask you when you plan to marry her, she shouldn‚Äôt have to wait so long without an explanation that she agrees with and you both came to decide together. No one wants to beg to be shown love and commitment, and she probably would feel like a jerk for bringing it up to the extent that it impacted her emotions because she probably doesn‚Äôt want to come off as being controlling or demanding of you. She most likely feels taken advantage of for her time, leniency, and most of all, love. She didn‚Äôt feel included in the decision making process, and she most likely feels like you‚Äôre only proposing out of convenience for your time and your life, but gave no consideration to her time and her life. It doesn‚Äôt feel personal to her at all and more so feels like you‚Äôre checking a box to be married at x age and she just so happened to be there. I know this comment is harsh, and potentially confronting, but I‚Äôm not trying to say this to kick you while your down, or call you an terrible person, my intention is to explain to you the multitude of reasons she would be upset and clearly show the difference between a couple that happily proposed after 10 years and how that contrasts to your situation. I wish you all the best, it sounds like you‚Äôve made a lot of grave mistakes and are now suffering the consequences of neglecting her feelings. I hope that this can be a time of reflection and growth for you where you can communicate your understanding of her feelings and acknowledge your many mistakes, and then face the reality of your actions either through that being closure at the end of your relationship, or a new chapter where you become a better person for not just her, but for yourself.

Try to have a conversation with her and talk about your relationship and listen to what she is telling you and what she is feeling. Try to not take things personal and actually try to listen to her side and see where she is coming from, you also need to be vulnerable enough to honestly communicate how you feel and what you‚Äôve been dealing with and why you took so long. She could quite honestly be feeling like you weren‚Äôt showing her enough love or showing her how worthy she is, she could be conflicted because you took so long to show her that you‚Äôre ready to commit and she might have been self conscious about that. 10 years *is* a long time. \n\nI have a ADHD husband and I noticed you guys have a really hard time with your emotions, emotional issues, communication and lack of romantic expression and rejection sensitivity. I suggest you guys sit down and have a conversation about where you guys are at in the relationship. What are some things that you both have had issues with, talk to each other *honestly and openly*. If she‚Äôs willing to give you a chance and not break up with you, try to see if you can resolve things. start to prioritize the things that you need to prioritize and accommodate for yourself so that your ADHD doesn‚Äôt make you lose focus of the things you WANT to prioritize.

I never graduated college, but I fell into a specialization in the construction field where that didn't matter. We both throw extra money towards it when we can.\n\nBut keep in mind we eloped, 4 friends came as witnesses, and the entirety of our wedding cost $200, with license, because having 2 health insurance plans was cost prohibitive (we were engaged, but pushed up the legal date because the company i worked for had great insurance). In our case, the yearly insurance savings was significant enough, that even my very pissed father couldn't fault the logic.\n\nMaybe consider meeting with a cpa or someone of that vein, to get an idea of how being married can help/hurt finances, and to make sure you have a healthy handle on your finances, and if there are simplistic means you could use to pay it faster. But do not let them push you into signing up for cc's, Accounts, etc. The key is smart long term planning, while you are still young, and a healthy relationship with money/debt. There are even therapists who specialize in financial & mental health as one entity.\n\n2 random suggestions I use, because i dont like debt hanging over me:\nPaying bi-weekly/weekly (depending on your pay schedule), as opposed to monthly, gives you 2-4 extra payments a year. Those payments go towards the principal in most loans.\n\nRound/bump the divided payments up. I generally add $15-20 if I can, but even $1 or $5 is still money towards that end number.",
