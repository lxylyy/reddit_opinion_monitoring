When the United States becomes a violent hate-filled place, where will they go? So they think, Running away didn‚Äôt work. Fighting it won‚Äôt work. So they throw the beast a treat by voting for it, then try to ignore it, hoping it will go away. \n\nAnd, to be extremely blunt, nobody is different than the country they grew up in. If hatred and intolerance where you grew up reached the point of mass murder, then it seems very moderate to simply vote Republican. They would never physically hurt their neighbors, but perhaps xenophobia feels natural to them. Perhaps Trump‚Äôs rhetoric is comfortingly familiar without being an outright call for mass murder. \n\nTyranny lowers your standards. I had friends whose parents had fled institutionalized antisemitism in the Soviet Union, only to spend their old age being breathtakingly racist in the United States.
