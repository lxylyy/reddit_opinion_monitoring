She laughed and said ‘’Maurice, stop!’’\n\nMy name is not Maurice!\n\nWho is Maurice? I’m not sure, but I think it’s the guy in shorts who came into the kitchen after.\n\nAnyway, I left and have been receiving texts the whole weekend. Here some off my favorites:\n\n-            I never meant for this to happen!\n\n-            I’m sorry, I won’t do it again\n\n-            (the best so far) It didn’t mean anything. You’re the only one I love.\n\n  \nEdit: \n\nTo quote Cpt Holt: ‘’why is no one having a good time? I specifically requested it.’’\n\nSeriously though, thanks for the support. I appreciate it. And don’t worry, I’m fine. And like one commenter said, I know what to do. (no I won’t elope with Maurice!)",
