  "selftext": "I hit rock bottom a couple years ago and lost everything due to clinical burnout, mental illness, trauma, and multiple deaths in my immediate family. I had no income because everyday I was struggling to keep myself alive and couldn‚Äôt work, so my bills stacked up quick from only being able to make minimum payments; and sometimes having to delay payments so I could eat. \n\nThis year has been a huge turning point for me and I was able to get a job that I love, but it‚Äôs only part time and I had to do a slow-return to prevent burnout. I‚Äôve been slowly paying back my bills, but I guess someone got fed up with me and the bank ended up taking all my money for this month. I found out in Lush when I tried to buy a single bathbomb for my aching muscles after long retail hours. \n\nMy card declined. I played it off and left the store in a panic trying to figure out why I didn‚Äôt have five dollars, and I saw that the bank drained my account. My face must have given me away, because the cashier ran out of the store with the bathbomb I‚Äôd failed to purchase and just put his hand on my shoulder and told me it was ok. I almost didn‚Äôt take it, I was so shocked, and asked if he was sure, and he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a bathbomb‚Äù. \n\nI got into my car and started to sob, not knowing how I am going to eat and pay the rest of my bills this month, and I had moments where I wanted to drive somewhere and not return - but my mind kept coming back to this person who showed me such kindness and generosity, a stranger, and they in no way were required to help me. \n\nI‚Äôm still emotional over it; and I plan on thanking him when I get the bandwidth to do so. Let this be a message to show people small kindnesses when you can, because you may well be saving a life and giving hope. ",
