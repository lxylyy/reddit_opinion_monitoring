  "selftext": "I managed to evacuate from Gaza, leaving behind the rubble, the bodies, and the memories of the war zone. You‚Äôd think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety‚Äîbut all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I‚Äôd be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.\n\nI‚Äôm in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things‚Äîtraffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I‚Äôm expected to care about small talk? I don‚Äôt.\n\nEven after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I‚Äôm telling someone else‚Äôs story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I‚Äôm reading from a script. I can‚Äôtonnect to it anymore. It‚Äôs like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble.\n\nI‚Äôve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn‚Äôt register. I didn‚Äôt cry when I found out a friend of mine didn‚Äôt make it out. I didn‚Äôt care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it‚Äôs just blank.\n\nPeople think escaping the genocide means survival, but it‚Äôs not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what‚Äôs still happening, or hear about others‚Äô struggles, I can‚Äôt bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop.\n\nI‚Äôm broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I‚Äôm functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I‚Äôm just as destroyed as the streets I left behind.\n\nIt‚Äôs been 5 months ",

Your nervous system had to shut off everything happening around you and not perceive it in order to survive the emotional burden. Now that you subconsciously isolated your feelings for so long, you don't know how to feel or care anymore. And that's totally normal. People have that response for way smaller trauma. You'll probably need a lot of therapy to hopefully recover a bit in this lifetime. But it's totally understandable that your brain never wants to feel or perceive anything ever again.\n\nYou should also not blame yourself for not feeling as good as you hoped now that you're safe. The anticipation of the relief that you thought you would feel is what your mind fed you in order to survive and survival is our strongest instinct (which can be frustrating in this world, because often it feels not worth it to survive, especially with the things you've seen). You were in a situation of extreme and prolonged stress and shock, in a state of emergency, so your body and mind will need a long time to recover. They need a break. Our human minds didn't evolve to handle these atrocities and this level of destruction.\n\nTake it slow, one step at a time, just look at the close way forward and know that your feeling of numbness is valid. You need to give your brain time and when you're ready, seek therapy, even though it will be a long process to find a qualified therapist on this topic, few people can remotely relate to what you went through and their suggestions will sound tone deaf to you. Probably a therapist that specializes in PTSD could be good. \n\nMaybe also try to express your feelings to people who experienced the same thing and escaped, if you know any. They will understand you better than anyone. All of us here cannot imagine what you went through. At some point you might even feel survivor's guilt. But just know that you didn't deserve to get your humanity taken away like this. So try to get it back, at least a small portion of what you used to be. It's a matter of justice, it was stolen from you and you deserve it back. But give it time, don't try to force it. I'm hoping for the least pain possible in the years to come for you.

After being forced to immigrate from Syria due to the war, I feel as though I left my whole identity there; well, however big an identity one develops at 11 years old. During the past ten years I‚Äôve spent in the US, not once have I felt like my authentic self. Rather, I was a shell of a human. I still am, a shell of a human, passively going through the motions of life with no real care for what I‚Äôm doing. Similar to you, it feels like my real self got buried under the rubble somewhere back in Syria. This emptiness has gone on for so many years that I can no longer explicitly distinguish it, but I can still sense the weight of it somewhere in the back of my mind, haunting my every move, decision, and social interaction.\nRecently I‚Äôve realized this is most likely not something I can amend on my own, and I will need the help of a professional. What we‚Äôve experienced is not normal, and it should never be viewed as such. While we may get distracted by the mundane things that come with the newfound peace we‚Äôve been lucky enough to attain, the trauma is always gonna be there, interfering with and tainting our quality of life. Inner work needs to be done to address and dismantle it.

But I promise you the empathy is there; trauma just puts a block on it. Sometimes, it can be a very thick blockage. The sooner you start working on it with a therapist, the better luck you may have trying to break through it.\n\nMy brain is the same way from childhood trauma. My brain didn't work the same as the other kids'. I kind of started out that way in life. Talk was unimportant, I could not connect. I didn't even understand others' happiness. Seemed dumb to me. I still struggle with it because I didn't get help soon enough. But it still was just a blockage. It's a very good thing your brain does for you that allows you to function temporarily. It's looking out for you, even if it feels like it's no longer helpful. It's less of a brokenness and more of a demonstration of how we've evolved to navigate anything as human beings.\n\nQuick tip: Make sure to find a therapist that works with trauma and PTSD, specifically. Not every therapist is equipped to handle trauma, and not every one wants to. If you get one that shows discomfort or is unprepared, it can cause you to bury things more. I would recommend very regular appointments, even starting at once a week if you have the time.  For as severe as the trauma was, you're going to have to combat it just as severely.",

You will get better but it will take time, and honestly it will take ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù and acknowledging the reality of what is happening.

I would feel uncomfortable sharing details, and my way of coping has been to stay busy and avoid overthinking.

What is going on right now is humanity at its worst. \n\nI hope I'm not out of place for saying this, but I would maybe suggest you reconsider your decision about therapy. As someone who dealt (and still dealing) with CPTSD, which also is a form of mental disorder caused by traumatic events, therapy helped a lot. It is mostly about helping you to live with the memories that you have. It's like \"rewriting\" the memory - your brain puts it away with other memories and stops bringing it up all the time. It doesn't mean you forget, it means that these memories, however painful they are, just stop ruining your life. You know, flashbacks (when you unwillingly remember things and see / hear them around you), nightmares, all this stuff, it can get a lot better. Obviously, what you have been through is unbelievable horror, it's a million times worse than my experience, but it's a similar disorder with different degrees of gravity. My flashbacks stopped. The nightmares, too. There's still some emotional cleaning up to do, but I'm more stable, and the past doesn't control my life anymore. \n\nIn any case, I wish you all the best in your recovery.",
