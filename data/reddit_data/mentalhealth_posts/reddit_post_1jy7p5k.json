  "selftext": "This isn’t love. Back story: he stayed out drinking last night and locked his keys in his vehicle. After time and time again, of having to get my baby out of the bed to go pick him up after getting drunk at his friends, that the next time he did this, I wasn’t coming to pick him up and getting my baby out of the bed again for his immaturity and acholism. Well as usual this time he locks his keys in his truck. He wanted me to come pick him up and I didn’t. When he came home, he made sure that I regretted not picking him up. Let’s just say, I now have no bedroom door or closet door. They are split in half in the burn pile outside. So many more things, I just don’t want to type on this platform. I have been struggling with how to make him leave, but it has came down to I am going to have to put a tpo and eviction on him to get him to leave my home. I can now say, when you ask someone, why do you stay ? I can honestly say, idk why. I guess you get used to it after so long, we begin to think it’s normal. It’s not normal. I am praying for anyone else out there, that is having to deal with this kind of situation. God bless you all. 💕 can you please pray for me? I would appreciate it.  ",
