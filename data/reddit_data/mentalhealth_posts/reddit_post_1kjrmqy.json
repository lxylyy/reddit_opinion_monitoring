  "selftext": "A bit of back story, my father tried raping me twice as a child, I am now 28. My grandparents had custody after 15 yrs old. After they passed and with no other family it was hard not to reach out at the funeral, hoping after 10 years it would be safe. Well it‚Äôs been 5 years since then. For the last year i have been sick and as of recent testing it is more than likely something terminal. I recently started the process of selling my home because i have no income. My father has set up his basement for me so i have somewhere to live. Over the last month or two he has gotten a bit handys and then today he told me he is attracted to me. He also said he would never go there but that he could see himself doing it but he wont. So now i have no income, barely any strength, and im stuck in a house with my abuser again. It makes it really hard to not listen to the darkness.",
