I'm closeted and gay, have been for a long time. and I met this guy my age, and we talked for a while, eventually he wanted to do a long distance thing. it was going great for months. last night I was sick and I went to bed early, just texting him goodnight and that I love him. I wake up to see that he said \"I'm killing myself, I love you, I'm sorry, but I cant take it anymore\". I don't know what to do, I feel its my fault since I didn't stay up, I wasn't there for him, and now I don't know what do to. I've tried to call him, and got nothing. I genuinely have just been curled up in bed bawling my eyes out.",

It is entirely possible that he is still alive. \n\nAnother possibility is that an attempt was made and they are hospitalized, but ultimately will survive. \n\nDo what is in your control, but if you have no one to call for a wellness check (i.e. if you don‚Äôt know his address or any friends/family of his), then try to get in a support group and work through this.
