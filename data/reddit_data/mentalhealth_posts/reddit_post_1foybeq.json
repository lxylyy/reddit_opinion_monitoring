I‚Äôve read some really great responses that I will take personal insight from. I don‚Äôt think I have anything new to offer. I just want to impart a little hope, maybe?\n\nComplex grief is so cruel. This will absolutely be a ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù moment in your life. You will probably carry the pain and unfair degree of remorse forever. It will lessen, of course. But it won‚Äôt leave. Again..I was up at some ungodly hour to post my own tragedy, just now. \n\nHere is a small difference that 3 years have brought. While I am up and hurting, I opted to sit with it vs. run for the Xanax. I sit with it more and more. It‚Äôs true what they say about how grief is like an ocean wave. You‚Äôre flailing in the undercurrent of a tsunami, rn. But the reality is, there is no water. \n\nHere is a big difference..this type of pain can be profoundly motivating. It reminds me of the motivation of terror. I experienced that, once. I still marvel at the speed I ran and the ground I covered. I am a stout, pokey thing, and I experienced a ‚Äúlift the car off a child‚Äù moment. Only in this case, the terrifying thing has happened. It is real. The child is dead. Instead of a quick burst of super adrenaline to fix an immediate, but potentially FIXABLE issue, you will instead be numbed into a sort of functional death march..but believe me when I say this..if you can survive the death march, you will be an utterly changed person on the other side of it. \n\nPoor stranger, I dearly hope you can wait to meet that person.",

You have a big heart to wish he was still alive after everything you‚Äôve been through. I just can‚Äôt stress this enough‚Äî it is NEVER your fault. A man can and will absolutely ruin your life and turn it upside down. The man that abused me happened to get me pregnant, and after I broke up with him, not only did I have to contact police to get him to stop stalking my friends and family and me- but I also almost died from the abortion due to bleeding. It was a huge wake up call for me to look deep within myself and figure out why I‚Äôm attracted to the toxicity, and what I truly wanted in life. It also taught me that I have to be extremely careful about who I give my mind, body, and heart to. Your love is SO precious as it is nearly unconditional, and it has to be earned. I can tell from my short interactions with you that you have a heart of gold, no doubt. Your mind and body is going to be stuck in survival mode for a while as you just experienced a harsh trauma. Your heart will be shattered to pieces, and understandably so. It‚Äôs gonna take a lot of time and self care to recover from this. After all you‚Äôve experienced, you absolutely have the right to put your needs and wants first, regardless of what ANYONE tells you to do. Let this experience motivate and empower you to grow as a woman. Also, if you feel a little relieved in this mix of emotions- don‚Äôt ever feel shame for that.
