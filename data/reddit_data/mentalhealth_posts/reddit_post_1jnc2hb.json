I truly loved her , but taking care of everything on my own including a child was abusive to me,she passed away two yrs. ago ,and now due to working so much and not actually enjoying life , I'm kinda lost, I was warned not to allow her to be my everything, but I was on my own since 13 and wanted nothing more than to have a family and be a dad, in conclusion, tho we may be late bloomers,lets honestly treat ourselves well, indepently, and allow others to do the same, the lesson¬† for me was , take care of yourself, before others take advantage of you, might be selfish, but no one can love me, like me, I'm older now ,but I will never forget the sacrifices I made to please someone, who apparently didn't reciprocate those emotions,this goes from job to home to people in the street, what I'm saying is respect,love and compassion should be reciprocal, and if not we as human beings can feel unappreciated, I'm sorry thanks for allowing me to vent",
