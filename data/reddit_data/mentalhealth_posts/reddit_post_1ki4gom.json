I think it's possible that the gesture was probably not judgemental, otherwise he might have chosen something more critical or dismissive of neurodivergence. \n\nI can say that as someone who got a dx for ADHD at 38, it was the best thing that ever happened to me, because I was able to make lots of changes that reduced *the struggle*. My parents were not informed, and were part of a world that saw ADHD symptoms, and perceived misbehavior or lack of effort. \n\nI'm envious of your experience, to be honest, because you are being given some information and an opportunity to decide what to do with it. I hope you can get something positive out of the experience.",
