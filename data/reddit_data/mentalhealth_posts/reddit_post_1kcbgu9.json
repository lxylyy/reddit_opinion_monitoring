  "selftext": "Hello everyone.\nYeah, the title of this post doesn‚Äôt match the picture because it‚Äôs my drawing and I just had no idea what to put there (hope u enjoyed it hehe). But anyway, that‚Äôs not what this is about.\n\nI‚Äôm 22 years old, and earlier this spring I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, OCD, CPTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder.\nWow, that‚Äôs a lot, right?\nYeah, and that‚Äôs exactly why I couldn‚Äôt get proper treatment in my country. I hope I‚Äôm not the only one here going through this.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm barely studying and not even sure if I‚Äôll finish college ‚Äî even though we almost don‚Äôt study at all. I‚Äôve had to take two breaks in a row, and since I graduated from school, I‚Äôve attempted suicide four times, three of which were seriously dangerous.\nI don‚Äôt even know what to say about that.\n\nI don‚Äôt have a safe environment at home. I‚Äôve been kicked out more than once, and one time I was thrown out right after being discharged from a psychiatric hospital (yes, that‚Äôs a thing too).\n\n\nI tried working.\nMy first real job ended with me in a psych ward. The second one pushed me into psychosis. I can‚Äôt function normally in society or get along with anyone for long. All my relationships end in conflict.\n\nI‚Äôm receiving some kind of treatment right now, but it‚Äôs still not enough, because I live in a third world country. I‚Äôve seen around ten different specialists, and none of them could help.\nI‚Äôve been on about 16 or 17 medications ‚Äî antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers.\nMy health has been seriously damaged because of it, and I don‚Äôt have the money to fix it. I also have no ability to work.\nThere‚Äôs no support system for people like me here.\nUnless you count the locked psych ward where they‚Äôll keep you until the end of your life.\n\nSo yeah :) That‚Äôs my story and where I‚Äôm at now.\nI just wanted to share my despair, because I no longer believe my life will get better.\nI‚Äôve tried everything to make it better.\nI‚Äôm not going to give up, but I don‚Äôt want to believe in miracles anymore either.\nI‚Äôm glad I shared this with someone!^^\n\ntranslated with chat gpt! sorry guys my english is not that good‚Ä¶\n",

It does sound like you haven't had the diagnoses for too long, and in my experience, the period where you're undiagnosed is the hardest. And I am in no position to say this and I could be wrong, but I feel like you should give it some time to sink in and for you to get used to having these diagnoses. On top of that, I don't know if you're doing that at therapy but it's also very good to know exactly which disorders cause which symptoms. For me that helped a lot, at least. And try to find communities here you and your disorders are accepted and understood. Whether that's with friends, family, or even just a community like this online. I'm free to talk if you feel the need to. My main advice would be to try to be patient with yourself and try to understand or figure out what's going on inside yourself. And find someone to trust and who will accept and understand you. You've got this, you're strong, and there are people who care about you.",

The fact that you are able to recognize and acknowledge that the current society we live in is not for you (at this young age of 22!) is great because now you've made peace with it. You're not broken because you feel the weight of incredibly unrealistic societal pressures. You are not wrong in how you feel. You are here to enjoy life. There is a spectrum of sensitivity we feel as humans from those who feel nothing at all and some who feel \"too much\". I've always been someone who felt too much. For years i didnt want to identify myself as sensitive because i thought that made me seem weak but the truth is sensitive people are not weak. In fact sensitive people are often incredibly creative and not meant to work a traditional 9-5. Im not sure if you drew that image but its beautiful and if you are an artist i want to encourage you to lean into who you are. Own it. Can't work a regular job? Thats ok! You find a way to turn your passions or hobbies into a job. Will it be easy and fast, probably not but it doesnt matter how long it takes to make money because it's truly about the journey. It  should be enjoyable. If it isn't enjoyable, then that thing probably isn't for you. Even if you try to convince yourself that's what you were supposed to be. It's okay to follow your instincts. Even if your instinct is to just take a nap and not be productive. Society is constantly screaming in our face to hustle but you cannot pour from an empty cup. Sometimes it takes shutting out the world and sitting in silence with yourself. Go through your options and see what feels better. Abraham Hicks says it's like playing the hot and cold game. You feel in your body when something feels better than the other options. Do what feels good to you- not what other people expect of you. This is your life. You deserve to live the way you want. You deserve to be happy. So if everything sucks right now, just focus as much as you can on the one thing that sucks the least and go from there. I'd go more in depth but i feel like Abraham Hicks can explain it better than me ( you can watch abraham hicks videos on youtube ) Ive already rambled on for too long but anyway good luck my friend! You are not alone. You are not a broken mess of person. You are loved and I promise you things will get better. Could be a day, an hour, a year, 3 years ,3 minutes who knows. The more you listen to your inner truth the faster things will change in your favor. Pretty soon you'll be living your best life and you'll know that this low place was a perfect place to now go in the direction of what your true purpose is. Sending you much love on your journey <3",
