I give couple exmples what my 6yo is doing: Her sister likes makeup and special effects. They watch videos together, then younger one tells me that someone did really scary makeup with scars and blood. Younger one doesnt like blood at all. Next Day they did some special makeups by drawing scars and blood to masking tape, and stick those to themself. I played along and asked what happened. Kid just giggles and told me its just makeup and not real. I think its better to ask frequently whats going one on with pictures. Like What happened here, thats a bit scary.  Because thats IS actually  a story. Ofc Ask about other drawings too, Even those that are not violent, then its feels safer to do those scary images too.",

Don't forget that, as an eleven-year-old, she is at the beginning of puberty‚Äîa stage in which many people tend to push back against family and authority. Asking about things that are generally on her mind might be more effective.\n\nPerhaps there is a story circulating among her peers or classmates that these images could be based on.

I know a lot of people are saying there is probably nothing to worry about and it's normal, I really hope that's the case, but personally if it was a child in my life (I don‚Äôt currently have any so what do I know) I would be a little concerned and would want to ask questions/keep my eyes open to make sure she's okay. I have drawn a lot since I was a kid and used to want to become an art therapist and symbolism can be important, but it can also be nothing of significance/just for aesthetics so I think it can be hard to tell.\n\nI think it might have been on a psychiatry sub I'm in, (I will try to find it) but not long ago someone posted a really informative article about what to look for in children's art as red flags of abuse. I can't remember them exactly, but I think certain things that seem to be present in this drawing, like sharp teeth/fingers, things that could look like genitalia (for example, what's that thing coming out of the leg supposed to be?)\n\nI don't say this to panic you at all, I actually saw this post the other day and scrolled past it but found it again because I kept thinking about it. I have friends who have experienced abuse as children and the affects are devastating so I think it's better to be safe than sorry - really hope it is just a kid doing random creepy drawings.\n\nEdit- not the original thing I saw I don't think, but the same information. I just thought I'd share this in case it could help, some of the things drawn that the website says to look out for I can see a little in this drawing.  I hope she's okay and it's good that you're looking out for her.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/s/xAT9pQRHfL",
