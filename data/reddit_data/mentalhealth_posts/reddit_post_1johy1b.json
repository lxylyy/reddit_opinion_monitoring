I would love to have something that would call me out. Sometimes I don’t even realize that I’m doing it. I have a trusted person that is good at reminding me to take better care of myself sometimes. But honestly, until it’s right in my face, I don’t realize what I’m doing. \n\nExamples: Not wearing shoes to walk over rocks. Chewing jawbreakers even though they can’t be chewed and it’s gonna cause harm. Running my hands over bricks or concrete when I’m nervous not even realizing that’s what I’m doing. Picking my nails until they bleed. Chewing on my cheeks. Digging my nails in the palms of my hands. Picking at my skin. Rubbing my tongue over my retainer until it’s raw 🤦‍♀️\n\nAnd I’m sure a ton more. I need someone to be like. Yo. You’re hurting yourself by doing this! Stop it! I’m constantly covered in bruises and such because I don’t even realize that I’m releasing emotions through self harm even if I’m not doing something that is classic self harm. I just hide it better than I used to.",

What you’re going through sounds so difficult, not being aware of the harm you’re causing yourself in the moment must feel frustrating. It may not be the “stereotypical” self harm but it’s still self harm and it’s completely valid. If there’s an intention (even subconscious) I’d argue that it’s self harm. \n\nI think this app could work well, but I also wouldn’t want you to feel bad about yourself if you were to catch yourself doing some of these things since you’re not completely aware of it.",
