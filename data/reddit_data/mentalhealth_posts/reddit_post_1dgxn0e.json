(A great example is when I thought my best friend abandoned me, a girl that I couldn’t live without and it basically shattered me. I started to slowly lose it and within 30 min I was hearing and seeing things that weren’t there.) They’re usually nightmarish shit. \n\n6.) And my current struggle and something I was diagnosed with in October in the hospital: Borderline Personality Disorder. Unfortunately one of the hardest if *the* hardest mental illness to deal with. Meds don’t work on us most of the time so often time we either hurt, kill ourselves, get heavily addicted to drugs, sex, etc to numb the constant mental pain, or are in and out of psych wards constantly. The only treatment is DBT, something that takes years to master for someone with bpd (depending on severity. Unfortunately I’m at the end of the severe scale) and isn’t a quick fix to stop the extreme mood swings. It takes a long time. Thankfully the only good thing is that bpd gets more mild with age. It’s starts around 35-45. I don’t wish it on anyone. Even my worst most hated enemy.\n\nPreviously Diagnosed but now not diagnosed anymore—\n\n1.) Bipolar (3 diagnosis’ it was really the earliest signs of bpd.)\n\n2.) Extreme Paranoia with delusional thoughts and actions. (Now it’s just *normal* paranoia lol) \n\n3.) Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features \n\n4.) Experienced Psychosis several times according to my psychiatrist. (Yes I know some of these former and current overlap a lot.

My mom being one of the main causes that led to the C-PTSD. Plus I can barely ever remember why I suspect the condition.\n\n- I can't have DID or otherwise specified dissociative disorder type 1 because she told me that what I suspected were alters were actually just intrusive thoughts despite me knowing my intrusive thoughts well and these suspected alters are nothing like my intrusive thoughts which usually consist of violence and paraphilias. And because my switches weren't \"blatantly/drastically (I don't remember which one she said) obvious\" and she couldn't tell when one took place by looking at me, despite DID abd OSDD-1 being covert disorders and dissociation just not being something you can easily pick up on.\n\n- I can't have OCD because my suspected compulsions don't consist of excessive handwashing or repetition.\n\n- And I can't have any sort of dissociative disorder at all because feeling off balance and like your house, family, name, bedroom are unfamiliar or unreal, and suddenly not being able to think clearly and going limp for quick seconds while being physically out of breath and weak from mental effort are all \"regular cognitive functions\" that I'm misinterpreting as something serious. \n\n- Cyclothymia is also off the table because the same self-harm she had me admitted into a partial hospitalization program for wasn't \"reckless or dangerous enough\" to be considered hypomanic because I was deliberately avoiding places that would do more harm than I needed in order to let off some steam rather than breaking shit like I used to do.\n\nEdit: and I have combined type ADHD.

It can also result (or mimic) nutritional deficiencies (thyroid, iron, vitamin c/d) and the brain not getting adequate nutrients. Some people suffer neurological problems from the disease (including depression). I suffered seizures for example, when my disease first appeared. \n\nThe relationship of this is still very under-studied and we are still learning about how our brain chemicals impact how our bodies feel and how we move through the world as a result. \n\nWhen exploring any mental illness, it’s important to explore the ENTIRE BODY, the emotional landscape the person lives in, the external cultural/social pressures they are under or other factors that could be causing why their depressed. ",

I still have a lot of shame and embarrassment, even in a supportive and anonymous reddit.  \n\nHoarding is often (usually?) an OCD thing, and I do have some obsessive compulsive tendencies, but nothing that rises to the level of disorder.  It's true that I have probably an unhealthy attachment to *stuff*, and I'll never have a completely clutter free and tidy home, but when I'm reasonably mentally healthy, I can keep the clutter in semi-organized piles around the perimeter of rooms so that the majority of the room is livable and functional.  \n\nMy hoarding becomes a problem when ADHD, anxiety and depression create the perfect storm of me not being able to do basic chores like clean and take the trash out.  That second one is the big problem.  It starts with *I'll just leave this bag of trash in the corner of the kitchen and take it out tomorrow*, and snowballs into *I don't want to go outside because someone might see me*, but one bag of trash turns into an entire house of trash when tomorrow turns into, well, years.  ADHD time blindless also doesn't help here.  It's hard to feel like something's urgent when weeks and days and years all feel the same.  And then selective attention means it's way too easy to become accustomed to seeing and maneuvering around the literal piles of garbage.  It's amazing what can become normal to a dysfunctional brain. \n\nAnd for sure, it makes depression worse, which means that I stop caring that I'm living in a literally garbage heap even when I pay attention enough to realize how horrible it is.  And it doesn't help my anxiety, either, because it adds the additional worry that someone will come to the door or somehow find out my most shameful secret.  It was also compounded by me gaining weight over the years to the point of being super morbidly obese and no longer being physically able to walk to the dumpster even if I had the motivation to pick up a trash bag and low enough anxiety to go outside.  Perfect storm of hoarder central.\n\nI've since lost 90 pounds, am able to walk more than a mile and the dumpster isn't that far away, so as long as I stay on my meds, keep the ADHD, anxiety and depression decently managed, I think I can keep the hoarding under control and won't end up back where I ended up before.  Therapist and psychiatrist seem to think that sounds reasonable, at least. \n\nWishing the best for you and anyone else with a hoarding diagnosis.  It sucks.  \n\n\\-----\n\nUgh.  I didn't want to mention it, but I kinda feel like I have to.  The main thing that pushed me to have to address all of my mental health problems NOW is because I had a house fire back in December.  It wasn't directly caused by the hoarding, but that certainly didn't help and is making recovering after the fire all the more difficult.  I lost almost everything, including my dog.  Now the entire neighborhood knows my most shameful secret.  It's the hoarder/agoraphobic's worse fear.  I've lost all of my stuff and I can't currently live in my home.  \n\nI'd already lost the weight and had been starting to try to reclaim my life, but it wasn't fast enough.  Please be more proactive than I was in getting help and figuring out how to regain control of the problem.  <3",

The bugs I never see are also an exception, like cockroaches for example. Never seen one in my entire life, which is lucky for me I guess! There are certain bugs I fear more than anything else too, like bees and mosquitoes. It’s all like a hierarchy. Even things like regular flies and ladybugs are up there too.\n\nAnd of course, mine’s severe, so even though I don’t necessarily fear every bug, the ones I do fear are more terrifying than everything else in the world and cause my quality of life to drop significantly. I fear bees 100x more than I fear death itself.",
