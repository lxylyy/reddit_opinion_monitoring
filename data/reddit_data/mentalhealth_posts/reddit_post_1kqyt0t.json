I was just really stressed and looking back I think I was having a mental breakdown of sorts.\n\nI know it sounds stupid, but what got me out of it was going for a walk with my dad, we sat on a bench in a town and he pointed towards a young teen in a wheelchair, he had no use of any of his limbs and I think he moved his wheelchair with a joystick. My dad said to me, \"just take a moment to think about everything you feel, and knowing how you feel do you think that boy in the wheelchair would swap lives with you in an instant?\" - it was a rhetorical question, he knew the answer and so did I. The answer was yes. In that moment, I realized my brain just wasn't working properly, I shouldn't feel like this, life could be so much worse, then within literally a couple of minutes it felt like this dark cloud had gone and my entire head snapped back to reality.\n\nI'm a lot older now and if I had any words of wisdom to give you it would be these:\n\n\"Life is a journey, sure there are good times and bad times, but it's only ever forward, enjoy it while you're here.  In 20 years time when you have kids, family etc... you'll think back to this time and think how ridiculous you were.\"\n\nMy favorite thing I like to say to people who feel like you is \"You might feel better tomorrow, next week, next month or next year and you might be fine for the rest of your life, we can never know, but wouldn't it be good to find out? Do you want to cut your life short before it began?\"\n\nI had a friend once, he committed suicide but was still alive from the attempt. I won't say how he did it, but his sister found him and had an ambulance called to his house. The last words he said to his sister was \"I did something stupid.\" They often say that the majority of people regret taking the action but only when it's too late.\n\nYour brain isn't working properly, understand that.

Tell her you're burnt out from studies and would like to request spending a few months at home with them whilst your recover yourself. Express that you don't want congratulations or a celebration of your success - the only gift you want is if she'd be willing to give you a few months at home to just recover (and maybe even some therapy). Then, when you're more grounded and out of that funk, you'll see how different you feel. \nRight now, you're seeing the world through a specific lens that is making everything seem hopeless and sometimes we just need a short break to recover. \nUnfortunately the world isn't made to allow people that short recovery break, but if your mom is supportive, it may be possible for you. \n\n\nI'm coming to you from experience. I'm 31 with nothing to my name and I'm in a place mentally where I've given up. I have no hope and I have no one. Please, try just telling your mom (IF she really is an understanding and supportive person). I want for you what I couldn't get for myself. (I'm saying this under the notion that your mom actually is a good mom. You know her, so please, if she isn't supportive, don't go to her. See if your university has a counselling department where you can get a session with someone to help you make a short term plan that will allow you time to heal. It is very important. An example could be helping you decipher where you can live and work with a little less pressure. The answer might be there but due to your current mental state, you can't see it. A good therapist can help you un-jumble your thoughts enough to make a plan.)\n\n\nGood luck stranger on the Internet. I truly, truly wish the best for you! \nI can't give any advice on the suicide thoughts specifically, because I've yet to find something that has removed those from me. However, I can say with certainty, that allowing your mind to heal really, really, really helps! When I had access to therapy I had a super breakthrough. Unfortunately I didn't have any support, loss access to my therapist and was still too weak. That along family issues caused me to spiral into a worse place. However, I stand by therapy. I know that if I didn't have the family that I have, I'd be in a better place today. Who knows, I may escape them one day. \n\n\nBut Internet stranger, it SEEMS like you have support. Don't be afraid that you'll disappoint them or something like that. Just be honest. Your struggles make perfect sense. The world is a very strange place that expects someone with zero life experience to just know what to do after school. It's like we're all thrown to the wolves. For some it is worse than for others, and then some lucky ones have support. It's more rare to not feel the way you do in some way or another after school. So don't feel like you're some kind of disappointment. You've proven that you're capable by your achievements, so your feelings has nothing to do with your ability. You're just struggling with the sudden and massive change to your life. It is perfectly normal to need some help. Most cannot get a break or help, but if you can get it, take it! Don't feel ashamed! \n(Again, I'm saying this under the notion that your mom actually is a good mom. You know her, so please, if she isn't supportive, don't go to her.)\n\n\n(As for your friends, they can't help you unless they have a lot of life experience. Unless one of them understands mental health and can be a person who can stop you from suicide, your friends are not really the best people to go to.)\nJust to elaborate on the \"stop you from suicide\" part: in therapy, when you are at risk of suicide, you're often told to pick someone you can trust who you can call during your worst near-suicide moments. [Your therapist will often take a contact number for that person as well.] It will become part of your suicide-prevention plan along with activities that can distract you, mental emergency service number etc etc. So what I meant is, unless one of your friends can fill that role, and/or be someone who understands mental health and can actually help you, they are not the best people to go to right now. This is a serious matter and you need people who can actually help. \n\n\nGood luck! ",

Obviously if there's more context I apologize, but have you asked her if you can move back in for a few months between your lease ending and finding a new one? Obviously it can feel frustrating moving back in with your parents, but she seems understanding & like she would probably say yes? \n\n\nIf there's a reason you can't, have you been applying for other rentals preemptively? If you haven't been I don't blame you, but you should tell a friend you're struggling with it and ask for help. Organize to go to an inspection with a friend and get food or something after, I struggle to do things on my own when I'm depressed but if I've made plans with another person I'm more likely to do it. My friend has similar struggles with executive dysfunction so we plan our errands and do them together often. \n\n\nFriends moving away sucks, but you can still FaceTime and text and things, and depending where they're moving to it might be a good opportunity for some travel and sight seeing if you go to visit. You should try and pick up a new hobby, join a sports team, volunteer at an animal shelter or something that you're passionate about, go to a group craft workshop, gym class etc. Remind yourself that you're capable of making friends, you've done it before and you can do it again. Getting out there can be scary and sometimes hard with depression, but it's still the best way to meet people.\n\n\nSame thing with a breakup, it sucks on either end but especially if you were dumped unexpectedly (I've been there). It can take a while to build up the courage to date again, but you will eventually, and you'll find a new person you click with. Being single in your 20s is extremely common and not the end of the world (even though it can feel that way) someone else will come along and fall for you for the same reasons your ex did, and hopefully it will go better, and you probably learnt a lot of stuff from your last relationship (not saying you were in the wrong, I just mean from generally maturing and learning). I've been in 3 serious relationships, and while they all felt amazing at the time, I can honestly say that every single one has gotten better, lasted longer and taught me things, even if those things were tough lessons sometimes.\n\n\nWhat is your degree in? Are you still passionate about it? Sounds like your results have been good at least. Do you have any plans to utilize your degree afterwards? If so look at the jobs you'll now qualify for and remind yourself how far you've come.",

Research therapists and find one that specializes in young adults and anxiety/depression and get in there. \n\nSo much of the preventative work of depression and suicidal urges is just talking. I believe this and moving your focus from the things you described to finding what purpose in this world you want to serve that would make all of those stressors completely irrelevant to you. It could be working at a dog rescue, literally whatever. I gave up on talking and finding purpose a couple years after where you are at right now. I have trauma from a family situation that makes me think taking any job just because I like it regardless of status or pay is a blatantly stupid decision. I believe it really limited me in finding who I am. \n\nSo to recap. Therapy with someone passionate about the phase of life you are in. Take joy in the process of finding what you love and how you’d like to operate in the world. I created so much anxiety for myself that I gave up and never did those things. Six years later I am in the exact same position, except worse because now I’ve got deeply rooted horrible habits to re-write. ",

To be the minimum level of functional expected in life it feels like i’m fighting a battle. I came from a poor family and have no real support system financially- i always overachieve because of lack of privilege and resources. I’ve often tried to reach out for help only to be mentally and physically abused by people close to me who don’t believe in invisible illness (yet somehow they have all called out for headaches before and they seem to understand headaches are real even though other people can’t see them). It can be hard when you have any reason to feel like this: fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, mcas, pots, diabetes, eds, lupus, ms, adhd, anxiety, depression, ptsd, cptsd, pms, pmdd, thyroid issues, and MANY more …. so much can mean everything is harder. so much can make just waking up take all the energy you have for that day. The world the normies built is extremely unhealthy and unsustainable for many of us with any of the above issues and with many more. America and its default settings are literally extremely unhealthy for any and all humans. Some people who don’t have all the extra baggage to carry may be able to maintain a state of denial and be ok ish in it. But it’s hard when people expect high performance and that’s where your praise comes from. I’m only like that because if i’m not an overachiever then i’m dead. My ability to work myself like an abused victorian horse is what they are praising whether they know it or not. that can be too much sometimes. i suspect op feels some overlap here. ",

When people that don’t have these thoughts start having opinions it makes it worse, I tune them out, and I feel more alone. That’s something people without suicidal ideation need to remember. Shut up with the advice, from your unknowning side of things it’s just one more person running their mouth uselessly and it makes you feel more alone when you all run in that you don’t get it. Empathy, or at least sympathy, is what you need to offer. Not advice or bs it will get better sayings about a world you just don’t get. Honestly, as someone who has been there, has survived an attempt, and still struggles with this. Yeah it does often get better… but sometimes whatever it is doesn’t get better…. sometimes we just get better at sailing stormy seas. And some of us don’t. I had a friend once say to me: promise to wait 10 years, hell even 5. Of you still feel like this after that long nobody can blame you… but if you’re willing to just check out, then you can flip that switch anytime… at least give yourself a chance to fight for you. I figured ok and i started trying to plan the perfect funeral. That all helped. Made me feel empowered. Every day I stayed was because I was giving myself one more chance before I quit. Then I still kept hanging on even later. I realized that i could do it whenever and every day i didn’t was a day that i took from this world and i was in charge of. Yeah i can quit whenever, it’s my choice. That makes me feel less like i have to quit. It may not help everyone. But that helped me. The thoughts aren’t going to win because i’m not in competition with them anymore. When they resurface i know they are just friends trying to tell me something(s) in my life are at a really big mismatch with what i as an individual need in a really big way. And i’ll tell you what, when people question your choices and you say you had to make a change for you because the situation or commitment or whatever it is was such a bad match for you that you were getting suicidal and that’s what prompted your change… people can’t really argue with that! It would take a really shitty person to fake that, and people seem to at least mostly know most people who say that are sincere ",
