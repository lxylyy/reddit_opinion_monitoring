      "body": "A quote I love is ‚ÄúSuicide doesn't end the chances of life getting worse, it eliminates the possibility of it ever getting any better‚Äù. \n\nSomeone on quora said this about it, which I love ‚Äú is suggesting that while someone who is contemplating suicide may be thinking that it is a way to escape their current suffering or pain, the act of suicide doesn't actually resolve the underlying issues or negative experiences.\n\nIt highlights that there is always a chance for life to improve or for circumstances to change for the better, but by taking one's own life, that potential for improvement is permanently lost.\n\nThe quote serves as a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there is always hope for things to improve and that seeking help and support can lead to a better future, whereas suicide cuts off any chance for positive change or resolution.‚Äù  \n\nIf you‚Äôre religious at all there‚Äôs also the concept of hell or something similar if you end your life. And the suffering and grief you feel doesn‚Äôt disappear, it will be forwarded to all of your loved ones and those around you ten fold. \n\nWhen you‚Äôre feeling your lowest, that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre already there at your lowest, and you‚Äôre surviving it, albeit begrudgingly. It can‚Äôt really get much worse, it just is what it is and that‚Äôs it. \nBut it can get better. \nAnd once it eventually does, it‚Äôs so worth it. \n\nWhen I reached points of happiness after a really deep depression, I remember waking up and being happy and just thinking ‚Äúthank god I held on a little bit longer. This is so worth all the hard times I stuck it out and kept it pushing.‚Äù As corny as that sounds, it‚Äôs true. \n\nYou‚Äôve got nothing to lose but everything to gain, so to say. \n\nEverything in the universe is working to reach equilibrium. Every action has an opposite and equal reaction and such. What goes up must come down yadda yadda. \nSo all the suffering you feel now, eventually, will be paid back with equal amounts of positivity. It make take a day, it might take a year. But eventually it will even out. So the more you suffer, the more good things you have coming your way. \n\n\nHere‚Äôs something I wrote recently, a short story or poem or something. Idk but hopefully it helps. \n\n\nI used to always tell myself ‚Äúyou can kill yourself tomorrow.‚Äù \n\nWhen I felt my lowest and really wanted to end it, I would think of all the things I needed to do first. \n\nI didn‚Äôt want my mom or siblings to find my body. Or my paraphernalia. Or my vibrator. Or be responsible for going through all my stuff and cleaning up my mess when they‚Äôre grief stricken. \nSo I‚Äôd have to get my affairs in order and clean up first today, and then tomorrow I can kill myself. \n\nBut tomorrow is my best friends birthday. I can‚Äôt ruin her birthday. I‚Äôm going to kill myself anyway and I‚Äôve made it this far, so what‚Äôs one more day matter. \nI‚Äôll make sure she has a great birthday and then tomorrow I‚Äôll kill myself. \n\nShe loved the gift I got her. Im glad she‚Äôll have it to remember me by. But that new show I really wanted to watch premiers tomorrow. \nIf I‚Äôm going to die I might as well watch it first, I‚Äôm going to kill myself anyway, what‚Äôs one more day matter. \n\nSo I watch the premier of the show and fall asleep. I wake up today and my grandma needs help clearing out grandpas stuff, it‚Äôs been a while since he passed and she‚Äôs finally ready to do it. \nShe‚Äôs old and doesn‚Äôt have much time left, I‚Äôm going to kill myself anyway, I should really spend a little time with her first, and it would be nice to go through some memories of grandpa before I‚Äôm gone too, what‚Äôs one more day? \n\nBut the look of pain and sorrow in my grandmothers eyes going through grandpas things breaks my heart. The emptiness and loneliness she feels now that he‚Äôs gone is palpable. \n\nWill my mother have that same looks once I‚Äôm gone? \n\nGrandma says she can‚Äôt bear the guilt feeling like it was her fault, if she had been home that day when grandpa fell maybe he would still be here. It eats her alive. \n\nWill my sister think that way about me? \n\nWe go through old photos and talk about memories. Grandmas face lights up and so does mine, as we laugh and go back and forth sharing stories. All the good times, all the hard times that we didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd make it through but we did, I forgot what it felt like to laugh. \n\nI forgot how much I used to love riding my bike. I forgot how much I used to love painting. Grandpa taught me how to paint. \nMaybe I should try painting again. I wonder if my old bike is still in the garage, it‚Äôs a beautiful day outside. It would be really nice to go for a ride in the evening. \n\nGrandma sends me home with some of her chocolate chip cookies. I forgot how much I love these cookies. \n\n I can‚Äôt wait to wake up and go to the art store tomorrow for paints. And that bike ride felt amazing. I should go for a ride again tomorrow evening. \n\nA few weeks have passed and I‚Äôve lost a few pounds from riding my bike. I forgot how it felt to look in the mirror and feel good about myself. \n\nI‚Äôve been painting a lot, it feels so good to have an outlet for my emotions. I‚Äôve posted some online and people are interested in buying them. Maybe I can finally get out of that office job I hate. I‚Äôll look into making a website for my paintings tomorrow. \n\nI met an awesome guy at a local art show one of my paintings was in. We went out for coffee and ended up spending the whole days together. I haven‚Äôt laughed that hard in years. I haven‚Äôt felt this good about myself in such a long time. We made plans to go to the fair tomorrow. I forgot how much I love riding the rides. I‚Äôm so excited to wake up tomorrow I can barely sleep. \n\nWait. Didn‚Äôt I have something planned for tomorrow? \n\nOh well. I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt that important anyway. \n\n**I know you didn‚Äôt say anything about suicide and I hope hope hope you‚Äôre not feeling that way, but this all applies to even a general sense of depression or going through a tough time. The point is that it ***WILL*** get better. It has to. You just have to hold on a little bit longer. Minute by minute or hour by hour or day by day if you have to. But eventually it always gets better. Always.** üñ§üñ§",

Your mood changes (endorphins), your outlook changes, and so on. Your *mind* gets taken care of by your *body*. So, since a body does its own thing and just tries to keep going, I became fascinated by health, nutrition, and overall wellness...which does wonders for the mind. All that said, trust that your body is rooting for your brain to not just survive, but to live. To really *live* life. It can get better, and because every forthcoming day essentially resets literally every 24 hours, your life can reset, too. It's natural. And that's incredible to think about.

Neglect and sexual abuse as a child. Then, I was in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship for 15 years. I left him 13 years ago and have been single since. I have huge trust issues. I don't have kids, I'm not close to family or friends, im disabled and can't work because I have severe scoliosis. I have a rare voice disorder called spasmodic dysphonia. All I have are my 2 dogs, which mean the world to me. I have Complex PTSD and feel numb 100% of the time, with the exception of feeling depressed and extremely lonely at times.\n\nI felt worthless for the longest time, and it took me 42 years to realize I am worthy. Some stranger on fb commented to me, and something instantly clicked in my brain. I actually felt i wasn't even worthy of receiving help. But what she said, it made me think, \"Why is everyone worthy except me? That's not right.\" It was weird, and since then, I feel like im worthy. Did it help with my numbness and depression? No, but it made stop the constant negative thoughts I had about myself. Every time I had a negative thought, I'd make myself stop. I always thought it would never work if i replaced my negative thoughts with positive thoughts. But shit, it does! I still have negative thoughts, but it isn't nearly as bad as it was. \n\nBut through all this, I know I'm okay. \n\nI've had a lot of trauma many people will never experience, but then I've never experienced certain traumas someone else might have gone through. I've been lucky and haven't lost anyone close to me. Except my dog 13 years ago. I cried for a month when he died and I still think of him and my other passed pets every day. Compared to some people's lives, my life has been easy. But we need to stop comparing ourselves to others! \n\nEveryone's life path is different. Yeah, some people may look like they have it easier, but really, we don't know what they're going through. Some people have it a lot worse. Look at the people in the Middle East or the countries full of poverty and war. Little kids with no parents or homes. Those are just a couple of examples. That doesn't include people who've lost loved ones, whose family doesn't speak to them, whose life instantly changed by an accident. Whose parents might be abusive narcissists. \n\nBut anyway, you might not feel okay and have a lot of shitty, negative thoughts in your head. But you will be okay. Humans are resilient. We can get through anything. We might not think so at the time, but wait, and it will eventually change. Plus, if life was easy, what would we learn? Life is about becoming stronger and learning. \n\nHave you ever heard positive energy attracts positive, and negative energy attracts negative? Like those days when you wake up in a bad mood, and everything goes wrong? You catch every red light, you spill your coffee, your laptop is being slow, stupid annoying things keep happening. Your negative energy is attracting more negative energy. Think about it next time it happens, it's interesting.\n\nSending you love and light!üíóüåüüíû I don't know what you're going through, but you got this! You'll be okay!
