My doctor referred to that as “waterboarding torture”. \n\nIt took me a very very long time to realize and accept that my depression may have been influenced by her, I even have a pacemaker at age 35 that doctors have said may be because of the stress of growing up with her, but I can’t directly blame her because she has her own issues that were never addressed. She will swear up and down she was “helping those kids”. It’s not her fault that she wasn’t given adequate care. \n\nThis is just an example, some people are just assholes to be assholes.

The shit advice comes from people that only ever had circumstantial issues I think. The difference is people are empathetic with their current situation so even if they don’t have any other sort of assistance I feel like that feeling of aloneness doesn’t hit the same. But then there’s people who have mental health issues on a chemical level, like their body is making them anxious, or maybe their body just doesn’t make enough for them to not feel depressed (sorry this is my relation, might not be entirely correct) or maybe their body doesn’t know what to do. Either way it’s long term and for some it’s a hard healing journey while others have a lifelong struggle and ultimately the people trying to help can’t help everyone but in my limited experience there’s not a lot of separation in the mental health field, only consistent one I see is the divide between pediatric and adult. \n\nI wonder if more effective care could be given if there was more specialization between diagnosis maybe? Like individual grief counseling but for anxiety or depression or bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Like they’re still educated on everything but they specialize and specifically help people with whatever that thing is. I mean even if there wasn’t a big impact today it would probably lead to new knowledge being uncovered because research through observation would be streamlined, I mean it could be the difference between the misdiagnosed today and the properly treated tomorrow.\n\nBut yeah “just calm down” mid breakdown.\n“Try getting a hobby” I mean that sounds great but it’s gonna have to wait for me to get the energy to move.\n“Maybe go travel” who’s paying because the cost of living has spoken for my money…\n“Treat yourself to a spa day or pamper yourself at home and spend some time relaxing” okay but who’s going to do my job to earn money, and my school work cuz I ain’t tryna be poor forever, take care of my dogs and do my housework because if it gets too bad it gets overwhelming until I breakdown and cry/angry clean to exhaustion and it’s not fun.\nBut please give me more tips for mental health that literally only work for people that are just in need of that. Sometimes every one needs a bubble bath with candles and some quiet time, everyone, or some variety of it anyway. But exercise and hobbies and self care only go so far when you’re imbalanced internally.",

How do I get myself to that point again where change is the only viable option? No one seems to be able to answer that.

It's better to learn to accept that happiness is just not being joyful all the time. That kind of happiness is temporary. Happiness is accepting the harsh journey and trying to think positively about it so that you will improve yourself slowly instead of killing yourself even more.\n\nOh yeah one more quote \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\".\n\nI swear seeking comfort is not a long term solution for mentally unstable folk.\n\nAlso the first actionable step is stop over-labelling yourself as mentally unstable. Only use it to address it is a problem so that you can solve it, not to label yourself as like that forever or for the sake of your own complaints.\n\nI am no professional advisor here but this is what I learnt from my experience. I would say it is better to recover even 0.01% than fuelling the illness.\n\nHope this helps 😊\n\nEdit: spelling",

And hearing someone ( especially a doctor) say that really hurts...\nbut yeah she also said worse things than that. She also told me to get off my ADHD meds cause it's a fad diagnosis that I probably don't even have (even though I presented her the formal diagnosis and I had done all the testing by other professionals). Oh and then she recommended I go to therapy instead of just popping pills. I have been in therapy for 10 years but she probably didn't write that down...\nBut yeah you are right, it's probably gonna be a fight forever...I was also told that I was just too smart and just too sensitive...yeeeeeey",

Social support system, financial situation, baseline personality, culture, religious beliefs (or lack thereof), and genetic response to traumas, etc. are all part of how pain is perceived by the sufferer. No one can make the call that someone has it worse just by the condition in question — outsiders don’t know and cannot know these factors.\n\nThat’s why doctors are trained (or should be) to treat the patient, not the X-ray. One could be visually worse, but if the “better” patient is the one to say they’re still in too much pain while the other doesn’t, that is 100% real pain and should be treated accordingly. There are no comparisons to be made. And this is for physical suffering, let alone mental suffering which is even more incomparable.",

Medication helps so many people and all that matters is how you feel about it if it’s helping you. Therapy can be beneficial but it can also be toxic at times like this. I’m sorry she said those things to you. “Too smart” lol well better than the opposite. Being sensitive in this messed up world really sucks. But it’s not helpful to be called too sensitive.
