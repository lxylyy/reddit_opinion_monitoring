The shit advice comes from people that only ever had circumstantial issues I think. The difference is people are empathetic with their current situation so even if they don‚Äôt have any other sort of assistance I feel like that feeling of aloneness doesn‚Äôt hit the same. But then there‚Äôs people who have mental health issues on a chemical level, like their body is making them anxious, or maybe their body just doesn‚Äôt make enough for them to not feel depressed (sorry this is my relation, might not be entirely correct) or maybe their body doesn‚Äôt know what to do. Either way it‚Äôs long term and for some it‚Äôs a hard healing journey while others have a lifelong struggle and ultimately the people trying to help can‚Äôt help everyone but in my limited experience there‚Äôs not a lot of separation in the mental health field, only consistent one I see is the divide between pediatric and adult. \n\nI wonder if more effective care could be given if there was more specialization between diagnosis maybe? Like individual grief counseling but for anxiety or depression or bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Like they‚Äôre still educated on everything but they specialize and specifically help people with whatever that thing is. I mean even if there wasn‚Äôt a big impact today it would probably lead to new knowledge being uncovered because research through observation would be streamlined, I mean it could be the difference between the misdiagnosed today and the properly treated tomorrow.\n\nBut yeah ‚Äújust calm down‚Äù mid breakdown.\n‚ÄúTry getting a hobby‚Äù I mean that sounds great but it‚Äôs gonna have to wait for me to get the energy to move.\n‚ÄúMaybe go travel‚Äù who‚Äôs paying because the cost of living has spoken for my money‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúTreat yourself to a spa day or pamper yourself at home and spend some time relaxing‚Äù okay but who‚Äôs going to do my job to earn money, and my school work cuz I ain‚Äôt tryna be poor forever, take care of my dogs and do my housework because if it gets too bad it gets overwhelming until I breakdown and cry/angry clean to exhaustion and it‚Äôs not fun.\nBut please give me more tips for mental health that literally only work for people that are just in need of that.
