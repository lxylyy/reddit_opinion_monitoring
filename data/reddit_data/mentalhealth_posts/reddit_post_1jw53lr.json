  "selftext": "I hate being a woman. We have the short end of the stick in literally every physical regard — we’re weaker, more impacted by hormonal fluctuations, and eternally hobbled by our role in reproduction. I hate my body for its weakness, I hate that no matter what I do in my athletic pursuits I will never approach the abilities of a man, I hate that I will achieve anything worthwhile in comparison to even an average man in any physical domain. My body disgusts me. I revile it.\n\nI hate that my body was built for the pleasure and use of a man and his offspring. I feel like it never truly has belonged to me, I’m just watching over a factory until someone spins it into production. I feel like I’ve been created to be subservient, to both a male partner and the offspring that he will inevitably have just as much right to and benefit from as me. I hate that I will be discarded when my purpose (pregnancy and childbirth) has destroyed me, or when simply become too old to be appealing to the sex for whom the world is made. \n\nI genuinely feel as though I am being punished for something, like I committed some kind of crime in my past life. I sometimes wish I could just die and try again, but I don’t actually believe in reincarnation. I cannot adequately describe the distress my weakness and uselessness causes me. I don’t understand why God would be so cruel as to have created me this way. If I am to be weak, disgusting, and useless, why could he have not at least made me too stupid to realize it? \n\nI don’t really know what I’m looking for. I guess I just needed to say this “aloud” to somebody, because it’s eating me up inside. \n\nEDIT: After speaking with some of the kind and patient folks in the comments and going for a run, I have concluded that I was spiraling out here. While I definitely have the above self hatred issues, I am feeling it less acutely now, and I recognize I was being unreasonable and apologize to anyone I offended in that process. ",

The same argument could be said about a male though; our penis's are made purely for reproducing. The pleasure from it is just to give the species an incentive outside of having kids.\n\nI stopped reading there because, and I'm not licensed to diagnose anything, but it's obvious you hold a lot of self hate and I'd wonder if there is a sexual trauma in your past. \n\nIm not arguing which gender is better, but genders have their own good and bad.

Sometimes, because of a man's physical strength, if we can't do \"xyz\", then we're called not good enough. Also, being emotional is looked down upon because \"be strong\".

Is it possible for you to focus a bit less on that? Because there is a world of difference between the physical abilities of men vs women, but much less so when it comes to mental abilities. There, the bell curves are very similar; most geniuses are male, but hardly any men are geniuses, and below the “world renowned genius” level, you will find that for every ten intellectually gifted men, there exist several similarly gifted women. And I do mean analytical intelligence, not emotional intelligence.\n\nAre you talented at mathematics? If yes, then why be concerned about your sex? Math is male-heavy for sure, but if you’re good at it, then your brain is well set up to understand it. Would XY chromosomes have made your brain even more math-oriented? Pretty hard to know whether this is how genetics work. There are plenty of men walking around with XY chromosomes who are not particularly good at math. If you had been born male, with the same brain otherwise, you may have been no more gifted than you currently are.\n\nWhen it comes to power generally, you need only look at any country’s politicians to see that we have long since evolved past a society in which physical strength correlates with power. Who has the higher social standing and more money: a 70 year old Senator who hires former football players as bodyguards, or the bodyguards themselves?\n\nPersonally, one of my weaknesses is people pleasing, and I do connect that with being female. And I do think sometimes: “If I were a guy, maybe I’d be way more of a shark. That would make my life way easier.” However, once I think about that a bit more, I realize that being a tougher negotiator is within my control— it’s just less intuitive and a bit harder on me psychologically— and I also realize that there are a lot of women who don’t have this problem. I’ve met them. It’s a sex-related problem, but it’s also a me problem.\n\nI feel you on how you get instantly devalued once you use your body to make a baby. The only way for this not to impact your life is to choose a very good partner who won’t get disappointed by your post partum body nor expect you to devote yourself to getting your old body back, and whom you will never have cause to divorce. But those things aren’t that easy to predict, and it certainly happens that people marry at 30 and for one reason or another, it does not last for fifty years/until death, because that is a very, very long time.\n\nPersonally, I haven’t had kids and yes, that’s been one of several reasons why I’ve never wanted them. It’s tough because you say you’d love to have kids. Perhaps consider surrogacy or adoption? (I know there are ethical debates about the former, I’m throwing it out there.)\n\nThese days, a massive amount of shame is heaped upon women for utilizing the physical advantages we DO have. Namely, how powerfully we can move men if they find us very physically attractive. A lot of men hate that we have this over them, so they’ve launched a bit of a campaign to convince us to not use it. \n\nEhh, screw that. Yes, hypergamy is a thing, and it provides us with social mobility that men rarely get in the same way. Yes, it’s costly and difficult for men to date, similarly to how it’s costly and difficult for us to have kids, while dating for a young woman is easy and you should have your pick of men (choose wisely). A lot of men can go years barely getting any interest at all, while you could probably line up multiple dates each day if you wanted to. \n\nTbh I always found all this to be pretty fucking nice, and I’m certain that if I had been born male (and otherwise exactly the same), dating would have been exponentially harder. Enjoy it however you like, whether that means going out with wealthy men who will pay for fabulous dates and get you into exclusive events, or going out with a lengthy series of great guys in order to find one you truly love and want to marry. \n\nJust some ideas here.

The only people who say you're supposed to be subservient to men are idiots, which I'm saying as a man.\n\n\nThere's a reason people can walk over you like this, that society can make you think these things. You've been oppressed, beaten down, and you're resigned, and things will never change if you and your peers stay resigned.\n\n\nAnd even still, there are liberties granted for these perceived fragilities. Yes, women may be birth givers, but many give leniency for such, many are sympathetic and supportive, you have the power of life. And even still, why have children? If I were a woman, I wouldn't, and with that choice, you may find others who will cheer you on, especially on the internet.\nHave you heard \"ladies first\"? Or ever wondered why we refer vessels as she? Or the Earth as mother? Because some have respect for the role women play, and some have respect for the truly correct reasons:\nYoure an autonomous human being.\n\n\nGranted, this may not help if those around you are terrible, but know this, things are not as horrible as they seem.",

I am literally the means of production for men’s offspring… a factory is a factory. \n\ni said something similar in my first comment, but i’ll echo it here: if my body is built for men, their bodies are built for me too. it takes two to procreate, and i feel like you’re neglecting female pleasure with the idea that only our bodies are made for male pleasure, and not the other way around. yes, women sure got the short end of the stick with the awful side effects of pregnancy and then pain of childbirth — i am very scared of that too, so if i don’t decide to stay child free, i will probably choose to adopt so i can keep my body *my* body. however, although i have the ability to procreate and grow a fetus, in no world do i see my body as a factory. it sounds like you want children, but you’re very off put by being pregnant and nursing. why not adopt? \n\n> [men] have an advantage in every way i care about.\n\ni would really like to challenge you to think about all the disadvantages men have. i am honestly so grateful to be a woman, for so many reasons. a lot of op-ed pieces and podcasts will talk about the “crisis” that is affecting our male youth today. men are still so discouraged from learning emotional intelligence, from expressing their sadness, and they often are extremely lonely because they don’t form close male friendships. there is also a pervasive feeling of shame, since men get bashed online and in real life so easily just for being men. the world, however, is still largely patriarchal, making it an extremely difficult position to be in. i do not envy them at all, and i think they need better role models and lots of compassion. there are some terrible role models out there like andrew tate and jordan peterson, but our young men today i think feel so lost, so it’s easy for them to get roped into those communities. overall, i just think you’re idealizing the life of a man a bit, and i’d like to encourage you to take a step back and think about the advantages in a woman’s life as well. my mentioning of women being caring and having emotional intelligence is not about motherhood — it’s more so acknowledging how much men struggle with these things, and how grateful i am to have my wise, loving, emotionally intelligent female friends. \n\njumping back to how you used the word “disgusting” in your first reply.. there are literally men out there who won’t wipe their assholes because they think it’s gay :) search it on reddit, there are lots of wives who are looking for advice because their husbands are leaving streaks in their underwear or in bed. now if that’s not disgusting to you, period blood certainly isn’t. \n\ni may have more thoughts later but that’s it for now! i feel a lot of compassion for you, woman to woman — i hope you gain some appreciate for strong women in the world as well as your own body. i would suggest that maybe you’re dealing with some body dysmorphia. i would also advise going to a local library and checking out some books by female authors — i am currently reading ursula le guin’s earthsea series and loving it :) women are absolutely incredible and inspiring and i hope you can feel that way soon as well. those are my (maybe more than) 2 cents — best wishes to you.",

I found some things on her phone in conversation with this boyfriend. Things a parent never wants to find. It was an extremely delicate situation bc I could have yelled and screamed and punished, as my initial instinct was to do. But I took many breaths.

My past experience growing up in fear & survival, trying to develop the foundation of a lasting relationship with her and not pushing her away, knowing it would only cause her to lie, do things behind my back endangering herself.

I'll go into more detail. \n\nYour \"physical inferiority\" is based on the feminist perspective of viewing male physical attributes as more valuable. You will never be the fastest pitcher in a baseball game, that will always be a man. However, women have natural physical attributes that men simply do not possess. Women have a higher pain tolerance. Men have a higher threshold, meaning that they can withstand more contact with something theoretically painful before feeling it, but women can withstand pain for a longer period of time. Women have a center of gravity that is lower than men and that grants them better balance. Women also tend to be more flexible than men by a pretty wide margin. You'll probably be more likely to find ten women around you who can touch her toe to her ear than find five men around you who can touch their toes while standing and without bending their knees. Women also sweat less, which is, admittedly, a catch 22. Sweating less means that their bodies are less efficient at cooling down, but also makes them less likely to be dehydrated. Women also produce less testosterone than men. More testosterone in men leads to higher libido, more muscle mass, and higher bone density. That all may sound like a physical advantage if you don't read too much into it, but testosterone can also cause various forms of cancer and heart disease. Lower testosterone contributes to why women live longer. Women also possess naturally stronger leg muscles compared to men. All of this, and more, on top of the fact that ONLY women can create more humans. Only female bodies can do what is necessary to grow an entirely new human and even nourish that human after birth. The things that the female body does all the way from conception to long after birth are absolutely insane! Try as we might, no technology can ever replicate it.\n\nI'm sure the feminist doctrine is just boiling up inside you, especially since I brought up making little humans. The feminist narrative is a toxic myth. Feminism paints women as inferior due to the fact that the female body isn't as efficient at making *objects* as the male body is. It's all based on nihilistic, capitalistic essentialism. You're trained to look at things through a monetary lense. An obscured one, at that. You may envy the strength and prowess of male athletes, but do you ever envy the garbage man or the plumber? No. They're stronger than you, they're more physically capable than you, but you don't envy them because they are not glorified. And they're depicted as poor. Sanitation workers and good plumbers make six figures, you know. \n\nStill, this feeds into the feminist narrative that certain male achievements outshine female achievements. It's quite the opposite.  The NHL player of the year may get to be on the cover of a magazine, but that's for an outstanding performance. The mere existence of a woman and her feminine nature gives them value. Including their physical strengths, which are not publicly celebrated *unless* it is a kind of strength that is typically demonstrated by a man.",
