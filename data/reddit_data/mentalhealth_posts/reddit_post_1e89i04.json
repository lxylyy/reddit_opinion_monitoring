The way you put achievement in quotes mocking it by implying it's nothing to be proud of. Not having anyone to tell.\nHaving to try to he proud of yourself.  Getting the validation of others even if you have zero connection to them as a way to give credence to what you know you should feel but seem unable to feel. \n\nYour short post resonated with me. Of course it could be because I read far far too much into it, seeing myself in your shoes thus making it inevitable that I relate; I'll choose to ignore that line of thinking though. \n\nMy story is further along than yours but sadly the present isn't that I stayed clean. I felt similar to you when I got clean and stayed that way for over 2 years before succumbing to the siren call and grotesque comfort that drugs are. It was a sick joke and the devil on my shoulder that led me here. The sick joke was literally finding a sack on the ground while out walking my dog, a fairy tail situation I used to dream would happen to me on those days spent dope sick. The devil on my shoulder convinced me that using those drugs wasn't going to be a problem, it's not like I sought it out and it would be a well deserved vacation from sobriety (an idea so absurd only addicts would understand). Well of course I fell head first back into a life I believed myself to have left.\n\nOf course that's not the end of my story but it's where I'm going to end it here. It's not all bad news for me. As I said I'm jealous and that's because you've cleared the first hurdle which is to stop using and I am currently dreading my time to face that challenge which is forthcoming. \n\nThe silver lining to all this pain is my relapse has highlighted my original failure in understanding that for an addict just not using is far from being sober. \n\nWell OP, I hope your story ends happier than mine and as such I won't wish you luck... I'll wish for something far more useful. Resolve. Be strong.",
