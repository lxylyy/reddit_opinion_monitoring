It‚Äôs like a constant reminder that no matter how much I try to boost my appearance, it‚Äôs just not the same.\n\nI feel less like a woman and genuinely believe that no one will ever love me because of how I look. What hurts the most is knowing that the only way to change this might be through a cosmetic procedure, but those are very expensive, and I don‚Äôt have the funds for that.\n\nI‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîgaining weight (which is tough due to my fast metabolism) and supplements‚Äîbut nothing seems to make a difference. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to be taken seriously by men, and while I know people say life isn‚Äôt all about men (and I wholeheartedly agree) I still want them to find me attractive because they‚Äôre my preferred gender, but I feel like I will never achieve that because of the way my body is.",

Especially as our weight and hormones shift.  I also think the media has a big influence on how we as a society views beauty.  For example, when I was a kid it was all about big boobs and a small butt, then the Kardashians kicked us into the big butt exaggerated hourglass figure, and now it feels like we are in the middle of a shift again with so many people reversing BBLs.  I‚Äôve personally noticed a shift towards the itty-bitty-titty community as well and I admire the HUGE variety of clothing styles that can be pulled off with a more modest chest size.  As a woman who leans a bit on the larger boob size I can say just how jealous I sometimes get seeing the outfits girls with A/B cups can pull off.  \nAlso, since you mentioned concern for how you are perceived in the eyes of men (who, I should point out, should never dictate how you conduct your life) I understand the initial concern.  It reminds me of how I felt when I hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship yet and had nothing to base it off of.  And I didn‚Äôt have my first relationship until I was 21, so it was a very long time of unnecessary panicking.  In regard to that I‚Äôll point out that boobs are just one marginal part of the equation.  As long as you don‚Äôt date an a-hole, most guys don‚Äôt tend to limit their dating pool by breast size.  It‚Äôs more of a perk than a requirement, and if you meet the right person it won‚Äôt be of any consequence.  I‚Äôve had my own insecurities about my boobs and those concerns are usually swept away after a good conversation. \nAllllll this being said, if it‚Äôs for you and not for men, someone else mentioned working out, that will help, specifically chest exercises.  I think exercise will also help with your self confidence overall and so, twobirds - one stone.   I suggest you could also try experimenting with your style.  I think a big part of being comfortable with yourself is expression through clothes that make you feel confident.  Try out those different styles, see what you like and don‚Äôt like.  Heck, go on a shopping spree at the mall and even if you don‚Äôt buy a single thing, at least you‚Äôll have put some ideas into that beautiful head of yours. \nGood luck girly, I promise you‚Äôre doing great.",

And tell anyone who says otherwise where to go. It is your body and you have every right to feel comfortable in it. \n\nIf you choose plastic surgery, I have my own story as well if you want to know: \nI‚Äôve had plastic surgery myself for a part of myself I was bullied for as a kid.

And I'm embarrassed to ever be topless in front of anyone.\n\nI was saving up for a boob job but after research and a lot of thought, the possible complications and requirements for maintenance would not be enough reason for me to sustain having implants (financially as well).\n\nI was also in a relationship for over 10 years where I felt really insecure about my appearance, where I was compared to other girls frequently. \n\n... But that relationship ended. I ended up really focusing on my mental health for the first time in my life, going to therapy. Body image issues got worse. After years of focusing on my mental health, getting professional support, I was in a decent head space. Found I had other things to offer outside of my appearance. Decided to start dating again. Met someone who never nitpicked my appearance, compared me to other people, let alone even comment on my appearance. He complimented me, never made me feel so ashamed about how I look. And I noticed I started focusing less on the value of my appearance. \n\nI've accepted how I look to a certain degree. Do I still wish aspects of my appearance were different, like how my body looks or the size of my boobs or aspects of my face? 100% yes. But does it eat away at me and take away from my enjoyment of my life like it used to? Not anymore. I've even learned to really find positives of it in a genuine way. I really value my sleep and I'm so happy I can sleep on my stomach without issue. I learned that acceptance doesn't have to mean loving my situation. Maybe that comes later, maybe not. But acceptance means this doesn't remain a debilitating part of my life. I was too scared to try new things, meet new people because I felt I was unattractive. I also used it as an excuse to not work on myself because \"what's the point, I'll just always be ugly.\"\n\nOn a separate note, I highly recommend checking out r/abrathatfits as I found so so many women (including me) never had the right bra size calculated for them. I always thought I was a AA cup but even those were too big for me. However, it's the smallest available at any storefront I'd go to. The bra calculator gave me a more accurate size and I've seen many other women sing praises for finally getting a properly fitted bra after years of going off big box store sizing (personally and unfortunately not many companies make my bra size, the smallest possible size it seems). However, it led me in the right direction to finding something that actually fits me better and made me feel better about myself too.",

I once went through a program that coached radical self acceptance, but no matter how hard I tried, a little voice in the back of my head said no way, you are undesirable and will die alone. \n\nOne day, I described myself to my therapist and she was appalled at how I talked to myself. I described myself as disgusting, I told her how I hated my very wide, very flat feet and how it was so disgusting that my thighs have touched my entire life, among other things. In essence, i told her I was unloveable and would never find a partner. She asked me, is how I was taking to myself fair? Was it helpful? She indicated that in essence, I was being abusive to myself. Then, she asked me: would I ever say any of these things to my mother? A friend? A sister? Further, what would I genuinely say if I heard a friend describing herself the way I was describing myself?\n\nWell. It made me think. Nothing I was saying to myself was helpful or fair. The things I found so unattractive and revolting about myself were things I absolutely could not change, short of hitting the lottery and going under extensive, painful and likely mutilating surgical procedures. \n\nDo I love myself completely? Honestly, no. But when I find my mind drifting towards thoughts like, oh, you are undesirable and gross, I ask myself: is this helpful? Is it something that can be changed? The answer is always no. I ask, would I ever say such mean things to another human being? Again, absolutely not. Finally, how would I respond if I heard a friend saying these things to herself? Well, I would be horrified and I would 100% tell her that she was selling herself short.\n\nAfter consistently challenging my thoughts like this, I've found peace with myself. For me, it started as simply not hating myself and has morphed into accepting myself. \n\nSo I don't know if it's helpful, but maybe ask yourself these things:\n\n1. Is what you are saying to yourself about being so undesirable and undeserving helpful? Is it fair to you, when what bugs you is something that just is, and cannot be changed?\n\n2. Would you ever say something like that to someone you care about? Would you go up to your friend and say ew, you have small boobs and no one will ever want you? I doubt it. \n\n3. What would you say to someone you care about saying such things to themself? \n\nYou absolutely deserve love. There are millions of people in the world. Everyone has different preferences and desires. Absolutely you can and will be attractive to some people. And anyone worth keeping and loving will not be so shallow as to simply choose a partner based on a single aspect of anatomy. \n\nConfidence and self-acceptance? If you can nature these in yourself, they are qualities that are endlessly attractive to many many people. \n\nBe kind to yourself, you are perfect as you are :)",

I heard horror stories about breast reductions and regrets and sadness from those that lost their breasts due to cancer or got enhancements. I was at a loss for what to do. \n\nEventually I threw my back out one too many times and said enough is enough. I got the reduction. I had a very good plastic surgeon that performed a damn masterclass in anchor incisions and he reconstructed my nipples to be appropriate size for my new boobs while preserving my milk ducts. Best possible situation from procedure to aftercare‚Ä¶ but I still had scarring. One boob scarred more than the other and although the scarring is only noticeable if you lift the breast, I was still VERY self conscious about it for years. That, coupled with the fact that I am plus sized and my lack of boobs now made my belly look bigger, absolutely killed my self esteem. All this in spite of the fact that my back and neck no longer hurt and I was able to run for the first time since high school gym class, mind you. I could‚Äôve sworn there was just no pleasing me and I was doomed to be unattractive forever. \n\nI gradually started to get over it. I hooked up with a few guys that were so happy to be getting laid that I could‚Äôve had 4 nipples and it wouldn‚Äôt have phased them. Then I met my husband. The attractiveness of my boobs isn‚Äôt even on his radar. They‚Äôre MY boobs, and that‚Äôs why he likes them. And my god does he ever like them üôÑ\n\nI can understand self esteem issues. I think the most frustrating thing about self esteem issues is that they hold you back due to reasons that only exist from your own perspective. Because when it comes to men finding you attractive, there is so much more to like about you than just your boobs (which I‚Äôm sure are actually fine). Each individual person brings something new to the table in both casual and long lasting relationships and there are many things about an individual that others can be attracted to (physical features, personality, sense of humor, etc). \n\nWhile I‚Äôm not trying to reduce attractiveness down to only physical attributes, the moral of the story is this- Don‚Äôt be so consumed with shame over your (perfectly fine) B cups that you don‚Äôt even notice the hot guy across the room that‚Äôs been staring at your ass all night.",

I think what has happened is that you have spent enough time to label this issue as infinitely heavy. The more you think of a problem the larger your brain will perceive it as.\n\nSo for you the answer is that any time you think about your breasts, you stop yourself. Not change the tone, not try to swith to being positive, just stop all thoughts about this. It will of course be hard to begin with. But with time you teach your brain to not go down this thought path.\n\nThen work on self worth and meaning in your life.\n\nI think you should definitely seek some kind of help with this.\n\nRumination focused therapy would be an obvious place to start\n\nSometime peoples worries are valid, some people have issues that are real barriers. Fortunately breast size is not one : ) For me at least, knowing that most of my perceived problems only exist in my head, helps tremendously.\n\nAnd if you use Instagram and look at a lot of SoMe profiles, delete those apps immediately, they especially make women and young girls mentally ill, check out Jonathan Haidt and what he says about instagram and girls",
