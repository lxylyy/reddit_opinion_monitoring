Another thing i did was place things i wanted to keep onto my bed so that the floor was clear to vacuum! It was sort of like a reward to take everything off the bed and organize everything after i was done, but that might just because i really enjoy organizing. \n\nIts okay if it takes multiple days too! I had to clean all of my spaces and did it all within three days, cleaned the bathroom first, than my music room, then my actual room. My room was the worst, so cleaning the ones that weren‚Äôt that bad sort of got me into the rhythm of cleaning. You got this!! I believe in you!!",
