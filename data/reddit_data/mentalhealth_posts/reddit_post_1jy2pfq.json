She's okay (thank god). It turns out I was just overreacting cos smth like that has happened to me before, and I didn't realise until they were in hospital. Im really thankful for your guy's support and help I really appreciate all of you ‚ù§Ô∏è",

I don't know if I'm helpful \n\n\nI had a similar experience, an online friend became more and more erratic, with vaguely suicidal messages. Then he tells me \"goodbye friend\",  which just felt really off. He had *always* ended conversations with \"goodbye, see you later\". I know it's a small detail but it felt really important. I didn't know much about him except for the state he lives in. Just had to hope he was alright, tried to get more data about him but he didn't have any on him. Spent a few days thinking about the worst, that he killed himself. After a while, I was able to dig up a few possibile people who'd possibly know him. Eventually got in contact with his parents, tried to make sure he was alright (I did not disclose why I called or anything else). Turns out he was alright, but in a hospital from a stomach bug. Obviously a lie, he was Indian and people here would never ever let slip that someone's suicidal or mentally ill. Thought he made an attempt but was alright. When he was released, he told me he was in a psychiatric hospital for manic behaviour.\n\n\nBut I've also done this. Once I was talking to someone high, then talked about personal stuff like mental problems and pain. Our friendship was mostly around mental health, I met her on reddit, talking about ADHD. Told her that I feel suicidal sometimes, about the mental pain and regret for it all. Started not responding for a while or bringing weird nodding on opioids and benzos. She did get worried, and then I tried to make her less anxious, I told her I took too much painkillers and benzos, thinking that's somehow going to calm her. Then I pass out and wake up the next morning. Had several messages on reddit with those suicide help message things too.\n\n\n\nFelt too ashamed to talk to her again, hated how I just dumped this on her and made her worry thinking I offed myself. Took me a while to get the courage to talk again, but she understood.",
