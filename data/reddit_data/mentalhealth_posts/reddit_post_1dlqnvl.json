  "selftext": "I just found out my husband has cheated on me since I can't please him due to my surgeries.  It was his fault we got pregnant without a doctors supervision monitoring my health. I never knew I was pregnant until it was too late. Should I sue him for emotional damage, physical harm to my body, and my mental health? I need counseling so bad, but I'm afraid he'd go to jail. Should I just keep it in therapy? I can always delete this account.  I just wanted to hear different points of view. I swear I just want to d!3 than go file paperwork.  I wished I knew this wasn't normal.  I'm so fucking lost üòû  . I know people are asking why didn't I speak up? It's cause I thought this was normal in any relationship. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know why this post was locked but thank you to that one mom that want to give me a hug.  I desperately need it.üò≠üò≠üò≠. \n\nTO EVERYONE ASKING DID I CONSENT? HOW CAN I IF I'M HEAVILY SEDATED ON SLEEPING MEDS? ..... SOME OF YOU ARE THE REASON I DIDN'T SEEK HELP BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE JUDGED ABOUT LETTING HIM DO THIS TO ME FOR YEARS.  \n\nI SAID SUE BECAUSE IF I WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY  WITH ANOTHER MAN I WOULD HAVE TO BE ARTIFICIALLY  INSIMINATED.  THAT COST MONEY I WOULD NEVER HAVE.\n\n I TRULY THOUGHT ALL WIVES DID THIS IN THEIR MARRIAGE SO THEIR HUSBAND CAN STILL BE PLEASED. \n\nI GREW UP IN RELIGIOUS HOUSEHOLD THAT NEVER HUGGED, NEVER SAID I LOVE YOU, NEVER DISCUSSED SEX NOR RELATIONSHIP ADVICE... \n\n I'VE HAD TO LEARN EVERYTHING FIRST HAND. Again, I was 19 yrs old. \n",

Document this conversation somehow if you can, just in case they are not responsive, as this can be useful in court. When you are assured that this matter is being taken seriously, file for a protection order and find a good divorce lawyer. The only fair outcome of this horrific situation is that you are awarded a massive sum due to your years of abuse, and he should be sentenced to a lengthy prison term. He is a monster and does not deserve to be free for what he has done. He needs to be prevented from harming anyone else at all costs. Any other documentation or ‚Äúproof‚Äù will also be helpful in court. If you need any help finding resources in your area, I‚Äôd be glad to help as I am experienced in social work and therapy.

What he‚Äôs been doing to you is SA and his complete disregard for the pain and health complications he KNOW it causes you shows how little he prioritizes you and whatever care he has for you.  He‚Äôs consistently prioritized his sex drive over everything else and that makes him a dangerous man. \n\nOn the other side, as someone who‚Äôs gone through the court process for SA, I spent a year in trial against my abuser over two counts, one where I was incapacitated and drunk and there were multiple witnesses, and one where I was asleep. I spent a year on the phone and in meetings with lawyers and advocates and prosecutors, and it was awful. I was constantly having to relive and retell what he did to me, in excruciating detail, again and again. Because the courts need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, I was questioned and every single detail of my abuse was picked apart under a microscope. And after all of that, the case was dropped at a year, didn‚Äôt make it to the courtroom, all because there was a POSSIBILITY the court would‚Äôve perceived us as dating and the jury would‚Äôve eaten me alive. My prosecutors were angels, they were so kind and they fought for me so hard. But they told me that ultimately it boiled down to the jury and with the complexity of it, with the potential perception that we‚Äôd been dating,  she did not want me to be subjected to a jury and the defense when that perception was on the table. \n\nI only pursued the case after finding out the same guy had done it to another girl about six months after me. I wanted repercussions so he could never hurt another person again, so I chose to pursue a criminal case over a civil case. And the court process made me relive that and second guess my own experience constantly for a year, only for the case to get dropped. \nI won‚Äôt tell you what you should or shouldn‚Äôt do by any means. All I‚Äôll say is that, as someone who went through that court process to fight for myself and protect other women, I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. The court process caused me an incredible amount of trauma and held me in that traumatic space preventing healing for so long, and he got off scott free.",
