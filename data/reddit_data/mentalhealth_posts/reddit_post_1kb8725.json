That self-awareness feels like a curse when you're trapped in behavior patterns.  \n\nIt's really important to know this: 95% of our thoughts, feelings, and actions are subconscious patterns.  That means that will power alone really isn't enough, since it's coming from the 5% of your brain that you have conscious control of.\n\nThe GOOD NEWS IS...you CAN reprogram your subconscious mind.  It just has to be done intentionally.  We are ALWAYS being programmed, so if we're not being intentional about it, we're doing a combination of two things: playing the same programs on repeat (\"I know it's self-destructive, but I do it anyway\"), and being programmed by others (news, social media, etc.)  Also worth realizing that our brains are wired to seek out the negative as a survival mechanism, so if we're not mindful about the input, we're just taking in bad-bad-bad-bad-bad all day... and it's contributing to the negative programming.\n\nEasiest thing to do ASAP is start pruning your social media.  It obviously takes more than that to break out of those cycles, but it does help a lot to be mindful about the accounts you follow on social, the tv/movies you watch, books you read, etc.",
