Struggles with depression are not new for me but the way I would cope with it was a lot healthier. Now I‚Äôve started cutting myself and I‚Äôve turned to alcohol to help cope with it. I even refused to leave my house for a year because of them. ",

What you‚Äôre feeling is completely valid, and surviving sexual assault‚Äîespecially by someone in the public eye‚Äîcan add layers of trauma, powerlessness, and isolation that make healing feel even harder. The fact that you‚Äôre reaching out and putting this into words is already a huge step, and you deserve support as you navigate this.\n\nI strongly encourage you to reach out to a trauma-informed therapist who can walk with you through this healing process. EMDR, somatic therapy, or other trauma-focused approaches can help process what happened in a way that doesn‚Äôt keep you stuck in survival mode. If therapy feels too big right now, even reaching out to a crisis line or a trusted person in your life could be a way to start feeling less alone.\n\nYou are not broken, and your response to trauma is not a reflection of your worth. Healing is possible, even if it feels far away right now. You deserve care, safety, and support. Please be gentle with yourself.\n\nSending love and healing your way!",

If not or if you consider coming forward however not to other people but authorities then you leave it to them to investigate, indeed you go against someone with money but the police report should also negatively impact someone's image in a more or less matter plus contacting the media with proof again you do not have to give away you identity , file a report , contact media , interview anonymously , whats the worst case scenario ?\n\nThey find the person \"innocent\" you get nothing and police knows about it which in future if this event repeats the \"celebrity\" will have more problems in future.\n\nBut let's not look at the worst case scenario , the \"celebrity\" will most likealy offer you money to shut up at that point. edit: which again will make it obvs they are not innocent and more proof comes out , more fans are gonna stop being fans and so on",

It‚Äôs great cost with very little return on investment (for some people, at least). I can see the pragmatism in what you‚Äôre suggesting, but it causes deep psychic strain to even do the practical steps. Many very strong, very resilient people can‚Äôt even say the words to their spouses/families, let alone to strangers who will tease through their experience with a fine tooth comb.\n\nThat latter bit is truly one of the worst experiences of my life, as I had to begin defending myself from interrogation-style tactics, just because I got a cop who hated people like me. I was told to expect nothing, and to essentially expect my file to rot in a back room for my efforts. I was hysterical to the point of almost crashing my car on the way out.\n\nIt‚Äôs a lot.",

Everyone has their own atomized experience, and people interact with varying degrees of safety nets, social support systems, and bureaucratic hurdles. It‚Äôs just worth nothing that there are very rational, very logical counterbalances to the suggestion of an optimal course of action for those who want justice. In many cultures, silence and disappearing actually serves the individual‚Äôs self-preservation and wellbeing more than a sense of resolution (the Middle East, many parts of caste-ravaged India, etc.)\n\nI wish the justice system worked in our favor, and it saddens me to know how few people get their day in court, get to see the smallest sliver of retribution, and find themselves all the safer by the outcome. I, however, would never impose the labor of the crippling task, upon the person who was most crippled by the event in question. This is where systemic change and other people advocating come into dire need.",
