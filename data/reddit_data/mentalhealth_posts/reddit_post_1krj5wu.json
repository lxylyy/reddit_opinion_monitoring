You were pretty ruthless in your comments, ngl, it's quite obvious you were trying to hurt him, and it seems like you aimed in a sensitive place (and hit); and then he retaliated, acted like a hurt child and tried to insult you back the best way he could (it doesn't even matter whether there's *any* truth whatsoever to what he said, he was only trying to hurt you back in this moment - so definitely don't take his words to heart). This whole exchange is just you two going back an forth insulting each other, hurling hurtful things at one another and trying to \"win\" that way... Which is how you both lose.\n\nHow old are you guys? I would guess young teenagers. Look, honestly, if you guys are dating, I don't understand why you still are. You clearly don't even like each other much. It seems like you have no respect for one another, and like you make each other miserable. Especially when I saw you mention in another comment that he has \"said worse\" - seriously, people who like and care about each other do not go out of their way to hit each other where it hurts the most. I think you would both be better off and happier single for a while. Do some growing on your own, work on your self-esteem. So my advice would be think about how that relationship and the way he treats you make you feel, how you feel in it, how it makes you feel about yourself, how you feel and what you think about him, and decide what to do.

He also said it was a good thing I cut myself after being clean for months. I broke up with him almost two years ago and I keep responding because of trauma bonds.\n\nAlso, right after we broke up, he became friends with my old abuser and my rapist. He very well knew what they have done to me and he even admitted it was out of spite. (he is still friends with them). He also flirted with most of my friends and the worst part is, they flirted back. They are no longer my friends.\n\nNot only that, but he leaked my nudes and was found guilty but I didn't press charges because I wanted it to all be over since I left the school after a suicide attempt due to being bullied and stuff. \n\nNot to mention he would say shit like 'he could rape me so easily' because of our size difference.",
