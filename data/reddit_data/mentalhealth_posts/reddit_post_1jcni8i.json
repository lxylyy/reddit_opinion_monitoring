However yesterday night I had the energy to take a full proper shower and got out all my spa day stuff, like sugar scrub, my skin care products, lotion, and body mist.\n\nHad a full mini spa day and around bedtime I made myself a cup of tea and put on a clay mask. I'm really proud of myself and I don't feel gross anymore.",
