      "body": "I wish I had been smart enough to export or save an audio message all my coworkers recorded for me.. but I didn't. ;\\\n\nBack when Covid19 first hit hard in the alpha-wave,. around March-April 2020, I spent 38 days in Hospital and 16 of those in ICU on a Ventilator. At one point while on the Ventilator, my vital signs got so weak the equipment was having a hard time sensing me (and the infiltration in my lungs and septic infection throughout my blood stream was basically killing me. (if you want to see longer description including Lung X-rays, go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oi4b31/people_who_recovered_from_covid19_how_did_u/h4t9dek/?context=1) \n\nWhen my vital signs got borderline unreadable, Doctors recommended to my Employer that they schedule grief-counselors to be at my workplace that coming Monday morning to be ready in case I didn't make it and my coworkers needed therapy. \n\nAround that same time my Manager (who I highly respect) emailed out to our Dept and asked everyone to record audio-messages to me as motivation to fight my way out of the ICU coma. (I honestly don't know at that point how my body fought its way off deaths door.. but somehow it did)\n\nAfterwards when I got off the Ventilator and had all the other various tubes pulled out of me.. I started re-orienting myself and I was able to find the Microsoft Teams channel where my coworkers had uploaded the Audio-file they had edited together that had all their motivational messages in it. It totally made me cry. \n\nIt was a surreal experience for me because had I not pulled through,. I would have never been able to hear those messages. \n\nI just wanted to share that story, as someone who had struggled with dark depressive thoughts at different times in my life, we sometimes forget how much others around us appreciate and value us. We tend to spiral and think that we're \"worthless\",. but that's a lie. \n\nThere are people who care about you and would miss you if you were gone. Even if there hasn't been an overt opportunity for them to speak it.",
