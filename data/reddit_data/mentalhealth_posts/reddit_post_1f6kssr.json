I do have some really horrifying experiences too and with each passing day I feel this ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a crime to be a girl! It‚Äôs a crime to hope for a justice in my country!‚Äù I am even writing all this with shivering hands, sorry if I hurted anyone‚Äôs sentiments but as an Indian girl it‚Äôs utmost painful to even say this!

I left India more than a decade ago, and moved to US permanently. \nI did not realize things were NOT ok while living in India- because I was blind. I was living under a rock too. I felt this is normal. (Almost) All MEN stare at females. Almost every female is eve teased. This is NORMAL- yeh toh hota hee hai. I have to wear a dupatta/ odhni properly over ALL my kurtas (with jeans) or else It would not look ‚Äòproper‚Äô.\nI was not even 20- and I accepted this way of living. \nThen I moved to California and realized - ohhhhh, so this is WHAT A FREE COUNTRY FEELS LIKE?? Holy shimmmizzles!!! ü•∫\nI am sorry to all the females living in the Indian subcontinent- but yall are not free. I know you guys can taste a bit of independence, when your Ministers,\nMedia, employers, papas or husbands assure you they are there for you. But that is not Independence? India is not independent from the regressive, misogynist chains and it may take a couple of centuries to break them. \nHang n there. I am so sorry you feel it. I totally understand where you are coming from coz most of the women have been there- I have been there too. But we cannot help it. No amount of media uproar, worldwide negative inputs, or change of political parties can change the nation. This is so deep rooted that a complete eradication is impossible - atleast in this lifetime. \nI do not want to suggest it - but try moving away my dear!! Move to lesser known regions in Europe. Get away. Work on your education and career to get you out. Do not rely on NRIs to wed you out. Be who you are without anyone‚Äôs help. You‚Äôll be proud if you do that. Never compromise!!

Whole life I was told to be like this or be like this and I repeat every single time I was made to feel if you don‚Äôt be like this then something bad might happen to you hence I took all possible precautions but still something really bad happened? My question only was WHY??? And worst part is I am not even allowed to talk about it you know how much courage it takes to talk about something this sensitive!! I have always been that citizen that girl who used to feel proud of my country and yes there are lot of good things in my country about which I am grate for but let me be very frank! Safety is a basic necessity for every single human being (not even talking about any particular gender) but here in India it all seems like a luxury available to only RICH people who are backed by Indians! And no I am not talking about crimes against women I am talking about every single crimes happening here be it accident be it SA be it anything tbh!!! Yes, for me going abroad is now a must to do list though it might be difficult and challenging to go to a new country all by myself but somewhere you know I wish i could take all women out here with me i feel sometimes i even feel should i go to another planet or something to feel safe for 1 day fully please!!? \n\nInsaniyat is a myth here though not 100% but yes a most part of it!! Ppl make videos and photo of accidents of victim of crime but no one thinks of helping here!! Everyone says ‚ÄúYou are a girl learn to protect yourself!‚Äù \n\nI won‚Äôt lie earlier I used to be afraid of street dogs now if they are there I feel bit safe and feel more scary when I see strangers out there staring like hell!",
