I hate being labeled as a country that might possibly be the cause of a genocide. I hate that my own president is literally considering ETHNICALLY CLEANSING palestine, and his little dick rider doing a literal nazi salute TWICE and seeing the same thousands of people support him for it. I hate how I'm watching my OWN PEOPLE get their rights stripped away from them, not only affecting my people, but people in other countries as well!! Why do my people have to be so cruel? Why can't we be normal? I wish I could just fix everything but I can't.",

Also this is a known right leaning organization so it‚Äôs possible the numbers are skewed. \n\nI will agree that many Latinos did vote for trump more than what was expected and the economy was a major part. The same could be said about the female demographic, particularly white women. People are often willing to believe obvious lies and overlook things if it seems they might profit in some way, and in a country that is built on individualism and monetary gain it‚Äôs sad but not surprising that people are willing to overlook blatant racism, misinformation, criminality and nazi rhetoric because they were told they might save a few bucks in taxes(which is also a lie as basically all economists not connected to the right have said).",
