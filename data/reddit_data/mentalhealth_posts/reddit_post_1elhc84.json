Like none of that went into the observation of seeing other people working their jobs... That's the lens of a child...\n\nYou know, if there is a heaven... I often wonder if the people who grew into \"adults\" would actually enjoy being in a place such as heaven? Because the cycle of conformity on earth is equally tied to survival...

I spent most of my life shaming myself for not being what I felt like I should be, where I felt like I should be in my life. Constantly struggling two steps forward five steps back. That kind of pattern. I do highly recommend seeking therapy if you're able. In Canada there are some free resources, I'm not sure where you are but going through whatever you can get without having to pay for it if that's part of it may involve a 6-month waiting list or longer but it's totally worth it if it's free. The other things I can say is if you can't do anything to feel like you can improve how you're feeling just focus on the bare minimum requirements of life. Self-care, hygiene, exercise, healthy diet and drinking lots of water. Oh and a healthy circadian rhythm. Start there. And maybe consider reading that book? You got this! ‚ù§Ô∏è",

I‚Äôm starting to be really mad with myself. As I‚Äôm very aware of my decline. \n\nI‚Äôm big on spirituality. Meditation, mood tracking, earthing, philosophy, theology etc. In the last 2 years i have completely lost that feeling of connection with my surroundings. Totally detached and jaded. It‚Äôs quite severely affecting my life in every way. Never used to be angry, claimed to be pacifist. Might have been an exaggeration. But i tried. Now i have a hair trigger. \n\nI‚Äôve tried just about everything trying to find it again. I‚Äôm pretty convinced the issue is rooted in the feeling of not wanting to participate in society anymore. I just can‚Äôt connect with people anymore. The way things are politically, economically, the trendy mentality, vanity and appearance being more important than intellect and skill. The list goes on. Just feels like world has become extremely radicalized. I really don‚Äôt agree with any of it. You can‚Äôt talk about it because if your views contradict another‚Äôs. The dissonance is too much for them to handle. \n\nI think the lockdown broke a lot of people, in a lot of different ways. Economically, our age group is the least well of financially in a long time. From college debt, to extremely low wages even with a degree. Having to rent because housing has become an unobtainable goal in most of the country. Prices in general these last 6 years. Really kills hope for the future when your 30+ and still live paycheck to paycheck. \n\nWhether you‚Äôre M or F. Dating has become unpleasant to say the least. Very few people cherish loyalty, honesty, and family values the way they were pre 2000s. And the whole war of the sexes going on, (man vs bear) (women vs tree). And still sex is just a casual thing. \n\nThe tension worldwide. All the wars. There‚Äôs just so much noise in the world right now. I grew up Catholic. At 17 i became agnostic-athiest. For 15 years i studied and learned. It‚Äôs hard to think this isn‚Äôt a holy war/spiritual war going on. There‚Äôs been a drastic shift in energy. Define that how you will. But there‚Äôs been a philosophical shift i haven‚Äôt pinned down. \n\nThese are just some of the things I‚Äôve thought as part of the reason. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve found anything that has really helped yet. Just hoping if i keep trying I‚Äôll feel part of something again. No longer following politics, got rid of all socials except Reddit.

Self diagnosis is a path to disaster.  Even expert  professionals can't reliably self diagnose. \n\nThe right diagnosis leads to the right treatment. \n\nI got put on 3 antidepressants for chronic anxiety and propanonol and diazepam for acute episodes. \n\nRunning really helped. But I got a fractured femur and diagnosed with low bone density in my femurs while my spine was normal. \n\nThen depression took over while I got anxiety under control mostly. Psychiatrist put me on ECT. That really helped, but is pretty full on. But later I got sacked from my job as a scientist as I was taking more sick leave than management wanted. That fucked me up badly for 3 months. \n\nTwo years later I'm feeling more stable and thinking about going back to work. I've been an inpatient 3 times at a mental health hospital. That really helped. \n\nBut I'm in Australia with an excellent public health system and private insurance too. \n\nTrust your doctors. Get the best care you can. People with mental health issues can be irrational about things like meds, when you're not in a good place to make rational decisions.  There's also a lot of misinformation out there. I'm lucky I'm a scientist and can check research and scientific papers on treatments and not get caught up in conspiracy theories which is easy to do if you are mentally ill, that's why it's so important to trust your doctors and ideally a psychiatrist, they are the experts on meds and other medical treatments like rTMS and ECT. Psychologists are good for talk therapy and working through problems.  But sometimes you need meds and treatments like ECT and TMS so you can get back to a place where you are rational enough to benefit from talk therapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist. \nGood luck.",

      "body": "Dear OP, I‚Äôm 52 and I have days where I feel like I need training wheels just to get through. \nI‚Äôm a widowed single mom, it was an abusive 21 yr marriage, I live in a different country than my homeland, and have no immediate family on the same continent. \n\nIt‚Äôs PERFECTLY OK to feel like you‚Äôre not grown up enough to hack life. I can guarantee you that of the 5 strangers you walk past in the next few days 4 have experienced the exact same feelings as you within the last few months and the 5th has the introspection of a teaspoon. \n\nIt‚Äôs part of being human, and part of having deep thoughts and pondering life. I get those days where I feel like this is too much, what am I doing, I‚Äôm going to mess this up, I‚Äôm going to lose control etc. where is my picture perfect normal adult life all the commercials and social media promised me - spoiler, they don‚Äôt exist.\n\nOn those days I just focus on the things I have to get done - feed the dogs, make sure my son eats something, walk the dogs, pick up the poop, put fresh water in the bowl, work, clock in, clock out‚Ä¶ just the basics. Then I go to bed and sleep it off.\n\nJournaling as you already are is an excellent way to get intrusive thoughts out of your head. Talking kindly to yourself and giving yourself grace is SUPER important.  No one on earth has a secret manual for how to live life. Sure there are people who make it look like they know what they‚Äôre doing, they‚Äôre just good a faking it. \n\nIf it helps you, write goals for yourself, tangible things that you want to see/do/experience/achieve in life. Then take each item and put under it a brainstorm of ways to make it happen, even if they feel out of reach for now. Take time to think about them, and on the rough days when it seems impossible remind yourself that anything is possible. Give it time. \n\nAlso, do you go to therapy? Sometimes just a few visits is enough to learn great coping skills  to work through the difficult days. \n\nI wish you happy days ahead and all the good possibilities you can imagine.",
