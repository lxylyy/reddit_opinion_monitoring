I'm so sorry it's like this for women.  I literally just want to TALK to someone and it be an adult conversation. ",

They need to see that being a man should mean something other than being a selfish asshole. They need to see that it is truly more rewarding to be a man who respects the agency of all other people equally, who recognizes the historical and contemporary oppression of women in society, who represents true strength, which is the strength of your character. \n\nBeing good and being strong are synonymous in this context, imo. Misogynistic people don't address their own shortcomings, instead blaming femininity, or else the collective of all women outright. They are weak and stupid because they have been dominated internally by their own insecurities and gender dysphoria. They are *jealous* of women, in a way. Part of them deep inside envies the level of attention and objectification women are subject to. And here is the dark truth at the heart of it all: the social construct known as gender is what puts men and women (and enbies) in a position to hate one another because it is literally a divisive category. Women are not essentially different from men. We can point to primary and secondary sex characteristics, of course, but these things don't determine your character and choices. \n\nAbolish gender! Reject society's baseless, needless, pointless expectations of your posture and behavior in society, because that is not freedom, it's slavery.",

Anyway I've never heard this reasoning for gender abolishing before and it's the only time I mostly agree with it, thanks for that.  However gender roles in regards to physical demands and many times the ways we deal with situations are always going to exist.  The last few years of the trans movement has proven that to me on the physical side.  There's always that diamond in the rough that do it all but it's not the norm and that's fine.  I don't expect to be able to do certain things as well as the women in my life.  I'd go crazy handling the day to day of my wife.  In the same breath she wouldn't do well with my duties.  As far as the treatment of others though, that is were the differences end for me.  Right and wrong is right and wrong no matter what as a human.
