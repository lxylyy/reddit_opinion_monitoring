But only to be hit with another wave of panic a little while after. But yea, what starts it are usually OCD thoughts about something thats bothering me or something I'm scared of or fear is going to happen. Then it's all downhill from there and eventually it passes, if I am able to talk about it to someone it helps, if im lucky. There have been times when it didn't pass after awhile and I needed professional help because it manifested in something like I was terrified to leave my home or I just couldn't snap out of it and it was manifested in over sleeping so I didn't have to be awake a deal with my mind (which I am prone to liking to sleep anyway but during these cycles it's way much worse, like I will use sleep medicine right when I wake up to try and go right back to sleep). It also manifests in isolating myself even more than I already do (I'm an introvert). Or not willing to be awake during day time, being afraid to see the sun. Feeling like I'm going to die, feeling like I can't breathe. Lol yes I have quite a few issues but they have gotten better over the years with help and medicines. But I have my moments where I fall and it usually starts with obsessive thoughts about something unpleasant that's bothering or scaring me for some reason.
