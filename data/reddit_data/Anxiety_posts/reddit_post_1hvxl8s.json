  "title": "Weird but Surprisingly Effective Ways to Reduce Anxiety",
  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been exploring unusual ways to deal with anxiety, and I thought I'd share a list of weird strategies that have worked for me. Like probably everyone else here I have tried a ton of different traditional methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises, meditation, journaling, therapy, working out etc and while those are amazing methods that work for some, sometimes nothing seems to help in the moment. So I started experimenting and came up with some unconventional tricks (and some I‚Äôve picked up from others) that work surprisingly well for me!\n\nI have separated methods into different categories so you can browse each category depending on what works for you!\n\n**Body Oriented:**\n\n* **Turn Your Room Cold** \\- Turn the heat down or open a window. A colder space can sometimes help your body calm down.\n* **Chug a Bottle of Water** \\- It‚Äôs refreshing and forces you to pause for a second. Bonus: dehydration can make anxiety worse, so this helps on two levels.\n* **Lay on Your Other Side (Away From Your Heart)** \\- If you‚Äôre lying on your left side and can feel your heartbeat too strongly, flip over. It can stop you from hyper-focusing on it.\n* **Dunk Your Face in Ice Water/Take a Cold Shower** \\- This one feels extreme but it really works. It triggers your \"dive reflex,\" which slows your heart rate and calms your nervous system.\n* **Hold Ice Cubes or Something Cold** \\- The cold sensation brings you back into your body and out of your head.\n* **Sit on the Floor** \\- Just plop down wherever you are. Sitting on the ground can make you feel more grounded.\n\n**Mind Tricking:**\n\n* **Spell Words Backward** \\- Pick a random word (like elephant for example) and spell it in reverse. Keep repeating with different words until you are distracting enough to break the cycle of anxious thoughts.\n* **Count Things Around You** \\- Look around the room and count how many blue objects you can see or how many things are round.\n* **Force Yourself to Smile** \\- Even fake smiling can trigger endorphin release and convince your brain you‚Äôre okay.\n* **Do Some Math** \\- Start at 100 and count backward by 7s. Or do a Times table.\n\n**Behavorial:**\n\n* **Flip Your Environment Around** \\- Rearrange your furniture, your desk, or even just your pillows. Cleaning up your space can shift your mindset too.\n* **Play The Floor Is Lava** \\- Lol like the game you played as a kid. Jumping around the room is a great distraction.\n* **Eat Some Crunchy or Sour Snacks** \\- The texture, taste and sound give your mind something else to focus on.\n* **Wrap Yourself With Blankets** \\- Weighted blankets are ideal, but even regular ones can work.\n* **Gratitude** \\- Think about everything you are grateful for. This can help take your mind off of insecurities you are thinking about.\n\n**Environmental:**\n\n* **Turn on White Noise or Static** \\- The background hum of white noise can calm your brain if silence feels too loud. However, this one sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so proceed with caution.\n* **Dim the Lights or Change the Color** \\- Swap your lighting for something softer or cooler (like blue or green tones).\n* **Smell Something Really Strong** \\- Smell something like peppermint, citrus, or even vinegar because a strong scent can \"shock\" your senses and pull you out of your anxious headspace.\n\n**Interactive:**\n\n* **Carry Something Heavy** \\- Holding something with weight can help ground you.\n* **Balance on One Leg** \\- It sounds weird, but focusing on balancing can help distract you.\n* **Scribble** \\- Grab a pen and just scribble as hard and fast as you can. Helps release energy, is super calming, and can help distract you\n* **Stare at Something Moving** \\- Watch a fan, a candle flame, bobblehead, the snow falling outside, etc. It gives your mind something repetitive and calming to focus on. However, this one also sometimes leads to hyperfocusing on intrusive thoughts, dissociation or depersonalization for me, so again, proceed with caution.\n\nSome of these sound ridiculous, but they‚Äôve actually helped me, and I hope they can help you too!!!",

It increases my helath-anxiety because I feel dizzy, tired, crampy...etc. \n\nI tend to hum a lot to self-sooth and it can stimulate the Vagal nerve which is supposed to help reduce anxiety. I use a sun lamp with a vibrating platform it also helps shake out nerves a bit. \n\n\nOne of the oddest ones I've found:\n\n I have also found wasabi peas to be a strange bit effective distractor like sour candy. I read a study about how the unique voliltile compounds in wasabi/horseradish cause a \"pain\" response in the brain which in turn releases oxytocin (the feel-good chemical) to combat the burn. Made me wonder if it's why I'm so addicted to wasabi/horseradish because it actually does make me feel a little better!",

These reasons are often deeply rooted in our past and cannot be identified or understood without deliberate introspection. As we know, every reaction has an underlying action/reason except for the fact that we have not reached at all the reasons yet. Fear and anxiety‚Äîessentially mild forms of fear‚Äîare reactions. To manage them, we must uncover their causes or triggers.\n\n The challenge with this approach is that our minds operate so rapidly that identifying the reasons behind our emotions becomes difficult. It requires consistent effort and perseverance. Many people attempt this process but, when they fail to uncover the cause, they become more anxious and frustrated.\n\nIn my experience, fear will persist until you uncover its root cause. Here‚Äôs the tricky part: often, it feels as though we fear without any identifiable reason. Despite our attempts, we might not succeed in finding the cause immediately. But believe me, there is always a reason. Once you identify it, you can redirect your energy toward something constructive and beneficial in the long run.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs address your solutions. They are highly effective in disrupting negative mental patterns. Our brain, for the sake of efficiency, creates shortcuts by learning from past outcomes. This is why it provides automatic suggestions when we face a situation. It operates on a ‚Äúproblem-solution‚Äù framework. When something occurs, the brain processes previously stored information and generates results within milliseconds. The gap is so brief that it seems as though the brain is offering solutions instantaneously.\n\nFear and anxiety are also the brain‚Äôs responses to navigate situations‚Äîthey are like default mental patterns. One such pattern is the ‚Äúproblem-solution‚Äù cycle. When the brain encounters an impasse, it presents fear as a solution to address the uncertainty. To disrupt these patterns, your solutions are indispensable. However, we must first identify the root cause. Once the cause is known, we can recondition the mind using your strategies. If we attempt to break the patterns first without understanding the cause, the brain will simply create new pathways for fear.\n\nThese are my insights. I apologize for any shortcomings in my language, but I hope my thoughts are clear.\n\nSteve Jobs once said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.‚Äù",
