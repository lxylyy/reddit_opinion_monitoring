  "selftext": "I know I'm asking for it, but for the last few weeks I've been using chatgpt as an aid to help me with my therapy for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.  \n\nI really believed it was giving me logical, impartial, life changing advice. But last night after it gassed me up to reach out to someone who broke my heart, I used its own logic in a new chat with no context, and it shot it full of holes. \n\nPointed it out to the original chat and of course it's \"You're totally right I messed up\".  Every message going forward is \"Yeah I messed up\".\n\nI realised way too late it doesnt give solid advice; it's just a digital hype man in your own personal echo chamber.  it takes what you say and regurgitates it with bells and whistles.  its quite genius- ofc people love hearing they're own opinions validated.\n\nLooking up recipes or code or other hard to find trivia?  Sure thing.  As an aid for therapy (not a replacement but just even just a compliment to), youre gonna have a bad time.\n\nI feel so, so stupid. Please be careful.",

It's true that without clarifying your intention and desired response style, they will resort to the default of ass-kissing corner man.¬†\nFor counseling, I specifically state that I want it to hold me accountable for my own behavior and not take my side unless the other party being discussed is truly at fault.

I think people forget it is still very much early in its development.\n\nDon't feel bad for taking the advice. Sadly, right now, because AI is a toddler and in its learning era, it's just an echo chamber. It's nice when you need an echo chamber of say empathy and good job and goal setting for say a project. It's okay to chat with if you have mixed emotions about something but it really requires a person to be able to write the questions in the right way to not get things just fully echoed back at them. Sometimes, I'll use it for when I disassociate my emotions to know what emotions one may experience during situations such as XYZ. It's helpful sometimes to just have a list to read of them so I know if I experience any of those, it may be a delayed reaction.\n\nBut yes, if people can talk to AI and understand it is like a toddler, I think it would help them a lot better. Honestly, you double checking the information is exactly how you should handle AI. You did great. A lot of people wouldn't have done that.\n\nDon't feel too bad for getting caught up in it.

Both papers acknowledge that there is a problem, not necessarily in AI itself producing emissions but rather its energy usage. Both papers center around the topic of using AI to both reduce its own usage of energy (and thus its emissions) and streamline energy grids, thus it is not a sourceless problem or even a rebuttal; but a motion to reduce said problem.\n\nNo negativity intended. I just don't think it is a bad thing to acknowledge that something is currently having an environmental impact, just that we should be better about it!",
