  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, \"Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.\"\n\nBut then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, \"It's okay. Let's take a walk.\"\n\nWe went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.\n\nI always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.\n",

It‚Äôs inspiring to hear that your boss not only handled the situation gracefully but also took the time to make sure you felt supported. That‚Äôs not something everyone gets to experience, and it makes a huge difference.\n\nFor me, managing anxiety has been a journey, and it's not something I‚Äôve been able to openly share in a work environment. I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years and often feel the pressure to keep it hidden, especially around others who might not understand what I‚Äôm going through. There have been times I wanted to express what I was dealing with but held back, afraid that it might be seen as weakness or even hurt my work relationships. Not everyone realizes how much courage it takes to even show up to work when you're battling anxiety beneath the surface.\n\nReading stories like yours gives me hope that one day more workplaces will create environments where employees can be open about their mental health without feeling judged. Your boss's kindness proves that there are people out there who genuinely understand and want to help, which is something I‚Äôve longed for myself. I think we all deserve to work in places where our mental well-being is supported, not sidelined.\n\nThank you again for sharing this experience and reminding me‚Äîand all of us‚Äîthat empathy does exist in the workplace. It‚Äôs a reminder to keep advocating for ourselves and to believe that one day, workplaces everywhere will start to see the value in creating a safe space for everyone. I‚Äôm genuinely happy you had this experience, and I hope it helps inspire more of us to speak up or seek out environments that embrace mental health.",

I have a theory about it I want to share and see if others can relate or if it even could help others.  I was always anxious, self conscious, worried etc.  But how my limbic system reacted to it was to fight.  Slam caffeine and nicotine, attack, conquer, go home and drink to calm down.  Rinse and repeat.  Lately, I‚Äôve become physically weaker, it‚Äôs a combination of age and if I am honest ‚Äúcomfort seeking‚Äù mentality.  I think my Limbic system who knows me better than I do understands that deep down if I stood my ground and tried to fight whatever threat is facing me that I would crumble and probably die.  Therefore the ‚Äúflight‚Äù half of the reaction is starting to happen.  \n\nMy plan:  Get stronger. Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
