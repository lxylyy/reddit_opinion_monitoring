  "selftext": "I promise I am not bluffing when I say something that my newest therapist said to me, really changed my relationship to anxiety and how I live my life. My anxiety is down about 50% these days and continuing to lower. \n\nSo, basically, what my therapist told me (who has a PhD and is actually qualified) is that people with High levels of Anxiety often don‚Äôt Trust themselves. This means they lack faith in their ability to overcome setbacks and challenges, thus creating fear of the unknown and potential pitfalls of life. \n\nThe second best piece of advice is that I needed to take Risks. Real Risks. Anxiety thrives on Avoidant behavior. The more you avoid, the more anxiety grows. Once I started taking Risks big and small, my life got so much better and less insulated by fear. As my comfort zone grew, my sense of self efficacy did as well. \n\nNow, this may not work for everyone depending on what is causing your anxiety, but for me, it worked wonders. \n\nTL/DR: Increase your Self Confidence and reduce avoidance.

Am I feeling this way because there is an actual risk? Or is it just an anxiety?\n\nUnderstand the cycle involved in anxiety and symptoms. \nThoughts - Feelings - physical symptoms - behaviours.\n\nWhat I find helpful is to recognise thoughts as what they are: just thoughts. \nLike clouds in the sky, they come and go. You can't stop them, but you can control how you react to them. \n\nUtilise \"Thought-action fusion\". - when you have a thought, it doesnt mean it will come true.

For example, we believe we are not good enough, we believe bad things abt ourselves etc. I feel , through the years of anxiety I have had and still working on them, it is also about the way we see ourselves and what we choose to believe. Hard to break bc belief system is like a web that has been created since long time but not impossible for sure. Sometimes when you hit rock bottom, you ask yourself, will i still want to keep believing this or will i start working on mindset change. It is so crazy how human body/brain works. Example, I have other health issues apart from anxiety and bc of that health issue, travelling is scary for me but travelling is what makes me feel alive too. So i push through and go for it, and i feel wrecked and drained and al shit feelings and thoughts in my trip. This is one way of doing it even if you don‚Äôt trust you got this, and in time i have done it and done it and yes the anxiety comes , i overthink it but i go for it, it doesn‚Äôt go as planned but it is better than limiting myself from the one thing i love to do .",

Something we cannot fully integrate into our symbolic understanding of ourselves. Do you think your shift was about gaining self-trust, or was it more about redefining what trust even meant for you?\n\nWhen you talk about taking risks, do you mean it in the sense of behavioral exposure, or was it more of an existential risk, challenging the fundamental coordinates of your sense of self and desire?
