If only the US has great example from relatively recent history that shows how prohibiting popular drugs doesn't make people stop using them, but does promote higher purity/potency variants to emerge in black markets run by violent organized crime? If only they saw how crime dropped following the legalization of said drug as people were able to buy it legally once again? Along with health outcomes becoming less severe as they were able to regulate contamination to prevent accidental poisoning that can be the result of residual chemicals from the process of making it? If only addiction rates actually went down as it became easier for the casual user to purchase less strong/concentrated versions of the drug instead of the highly pure and dangerous forms that were being traded by the gangs because it was easier to transport more potent products as you get more effect for the same space, therefore leading to higher profit? \n\nEverything I'm talking about are things that happened during the 1920-1930s during the prohibition era when America tried to ban alcohol. It didn't work to stop people, particularly alcoholics, from drinking but it did make many gangsters very rich while making alcohol more dangerous as there were no regulations forcing them to make sure they properly cut all the methanol from their distillation. It also lead to lower concentration\nBeers and wines becoming much less common, unless made by individuals at home while the gangs focused on high proof spirits as they simply made more money as they could charge more for the higher alcohol percentage for the same sized bottle. What's truly scary but not super shocking is that US government even poisoned illegal alcohol batches in an attempt to scare people into quitting the now illegal drug. It didn't work it just killed a bunch of people, while alcohol remained as popular as it ever was. Another unintentional side effect of criminalizing alcohol was that even kids started to become drinkers of they had the money to buy it. When it illegal there's no law that sets a minimum age for purchases, and drug dealers often don't discriminate for any reason as long as you've got the money to buy it. \n\nThe repeal of prohibition had many positive effects on society not the least of which was the new regulations that meant consumers could know exactly what to expect in each bottle along with allowing the US to make taxes on it, and setting minimum drinking ages so children weren't drinking from an early age. Methanol poisoning incidents became increasingly rare as the government set strict regulations in requirements to be able to legally make, distribute, sell, or serve alcohol by a company. Everyone generally agrees prohibition was an outright failure in respect to alcohol and that repealing it while regulating it was the best move for public health, but for some reason we can't seem to apply the same logic to other drugs that people use recreationally, or even in addictive patterns. Alcoholics aren't thrown in jail simply for the act of drinking alcohol (although they will still be arrested for committing other crimes while drunk. An altered state of consciousness isn't a legal defense\nIf you voluntarily consumed something to alter your mental state.), but if you are an addict of a different\nDrug, one that has been shown by study after study to actually cause less total harm you can be arrested, and in many areas the times in jail are higher than even many violent crimes. Think the guys in Texas who do 10+ years for weed meanwhile the jerk that beats his wife to a pulp gets maybe 8 years max, with 3-5 being shockingly common. Why are stoners punished more harshly than literal wife beaters? In America the reason is unfortunately historical racism. I don't want to explain more cause this comment is already long, but there's some shockingly direct quotes from Nixon's administration that admit to the war on drugs being a cover for racism.",

While it's not the majority of mental health patients that become violent when unmedicated, there are enough of them in this country that are being treated successfully that banning these sorts of meds could cause a sharp rise in violent crime. Also drug crime as people turn to the streets to self medicate, which rarely ends well for a lot of mentally ill people. Add in the people who might not have a list of people or homicidal ideation, but a more reckless attitude towards everything that hints at a death wish due to their lack of care if they live or die, but they're not willing to actually end so they just do progressively riskier behaviors in an attempt to either subconsciously kill themselves, or just to feel some kind of emotion as they're so numb they feel nothing unless they do something extreme. I've been in that numb, passively suicidal, and reckless mindset before and while I had no plans to actually kill anyone specifically, I drove insane because it was one of the few things that could get me to feel alive. Incredibly risky and I'm shocked I never lost my license or was in any serious accidents as a result. Not everyone will be as lucky as me, and it's very possible for people in that mindset to take someone else with them while driving recklessly even if they never actually planned to end anyone's life, not even their own. They just want to feel alive because they're numb and feel no happiness, no sadness, just nothing. It's a very hollow and hard to describe feeling that will drive you to wild things to feel something as when you're that numb you don't even really feel human, so anything that does make you feel helps you feel human again, even if it's very dangerous that mindset starts to not care cause even fear is muted. \n\nAdd in how unpredictable psychosis can be, as well as the economic impact when millions of depressed people are now too depressed to get out of bed or go to work and it becomes pretty obvious that removing these drugs will not be good for society, not even RFK would be able to deny that if people saw the real impact it had. I honestly think the role of big pharma lobbying will be more influential in preventing him from acting on this claim, and I wouldn't be shocked if they are using these comments as a way to stir people up and distract them while they do other much more destructive things. That seems like how trump and his cronies like to role, saying one outlandish thing to keep people busy and freaked out, while doing something else much worse for the general public while they're distracted by the wild claim that they don't plan on ever actually doing.",

The doctors should weigh everything including side effects, how quickly a patient needs relief, comorbidities the patient may have, med interactions with any other med you are on and ideally also the risk of developing a withdrawal syndrome if one chooses or is forced to quit their medication for and good doctors consider all of that before deciding on which medication to try for a certain condition. Psych meds shouldn't be an exception. Generally when there's one med or manygof a specific class used as the standard first treatment despite other drugs of other classes with similar effects it's because the recommended drugs have been found to either have less side effects while having similar effectiveness as previous drugs that were more common, or the drug is more effective than the previous drug such as penicillin vs sulfa drugs. \n\nSo while on some level I can see why he might have that view point but it also shows a fucktom of ignorance about how our health care system works which is what makes the safety of these psych meds much higher than heroin, even when quitting and experiencimg a withdrawal the prescription psych meds are often much easier to quit as physicians know the halflifes and can calculate the best tapering schedule to minimize withdrawal while keeping the patient as symptoms free as possible, which is pretty far from heroin where you have to be you're own doctor to avoid withdrawal but that's hard to do when in severe withdrawal.

As far as I know Klonopin is a benzo that was developed for anxiety that happens to help with stabilizing mood despite that not being it's intended effect. Much like SSRIs being prescribed for anxiety and OCD even though they were originally developed for depression. Or gabapentin with its myriad of off label uses beyond pain relief, like migraine prevention, easing of withdrawal symptoms in opioid addicts, and use for anxiety and other mental health disorders. Gabapentin was designed to help with nerve pain but ended up helping other things too and as such it's prescribed quite frequently for things other than nerve pain. I love my gabapentin cause it cut my migraine frequency in half and also helps a little with my anxiety which is nice. The only issue with it is that it's very easy for it to cause dependence in me and the withdrawals are pretty harsh for a drug with such mild psychoactive effects when using it normally. The withdrawal seems way worse than it should be for how subtle of an effect it appears to have on my anxiety and other issues. Other than the migraines which is a much more obvious difference but I didn't have any withdrawal associated increase beyond what I already had before I started the med. Although it would be hard to get worse than where I was before I started gabapentin as I was getting them every other day, it is possible for that to be worse and I'm so glad that I didn't get anything beyond that when I didn't have it. \n\nSo in summary, any drug that is used off-label as a mood stabilizer is likely safe unless it falls into one of the other categories that RFK wants to remove, While drugs that are specifically approved and primarily used for that purpose are at a much higher risk, which could also affect anyone who uses them for off-label reasons as well. Seroquel is a great example. Primarily developed and used as a bipolar med and is classified as an atypical antipsychotic, but it's pretty commonly used for anxiety, sleep, as an add on to improve ADHD treatment efficacy as well as a complement to depression medications when one or 2 SSRIs isn't doing enough. Seroquel also occupies a very specific niche of being great for bipolar depression without causing mania, which leads to it being used to stabilize moods as well as to manage psychosis, so despite all the other uses for it it likely is at risk since it was first created and approved as an antipsychotic despite it kinda being a fancy antihistamine but that's its own fun quirk. Interestingly enough my mirtazapine is also a fancy antihistamine. I apparently react best to allergy meds that are simultaneously psychoactive. Really makes me ponder the link between psychical conditions and mental ones, like how anxiety is strongly correlated with IBS, likely as a result of serotonin receptors being strongly concentrated in both the brain and the gut. The most popular anti nausea med,  zofran, actually works directly on those serotonin receptors in the gut. I believe it is not psychoactive as it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier but I might be wrong. Another funky one is famotodine, the anti heart burn drug. It's also an antihistamine but it's a non drowsy med because it can't cross the blood brain barrier. So it just reduces the production of stomach acid instead. Fascinating how often histamine activity shows up on unexpected meds that are never used for allergies. \n\nI hope this makes sense, taught you a few new things about meds and pharmacology, and helps you to understand which meds likely will be targeted and which ones are likely safe. As long as they don't go after benzos I believe you should be fine with Klonopin. Unfortunately anyone taking Seroquel for sleep or anxiety would be affected if RFK gets his way since Seroquel is primary classified and used as an antipsychotic. Gabapentin is safe (for now) but all the OCD meds that are SSRIs/antidepressants first and anxiety/OCD treatments second might want to consider \"dose increases\" ;) after talking to your doctor so that you can build up a stockpile by having a prescribed amount higher than what you actually take. Unfortunately this also applies to anyone who take any SSRI to help chronic pain as it's been show that antidepressants in general are surprisingly effective for certain types of chronic pain, with nerve pain showing a particularly effective reaction to antidepressants that increase serotonin. The most common used antidepressant for this purpose is actually amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's pain patients on SSRIs taking them to increase their pain management effectiveness that would be affected by an SSRI or antidepressant ban too. \n\nWhile RFKs rhetoric is extremely concerning for anyone who depends on any of the medications included in his rants, I highly doubt he would actually be successful in banning or reducing any except for maybe ADHD meds which are schedule 2 and limited in production amounts by the DEA. Most mental health meds are not categorized this way and are schedule 3 or 4 and therefore subject to much less stringent regulations. This is why a primary care physician and urgent care doctors can prescribe you SSRIs, but Adderall often requires a visit to a specialist. The reason RFK won't realistically succeed in banning SSRIs, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and other mental health meds is twofold. For one big pharma makes too much money off of these meds to allow them to be banned or limited in sale without some serious lobbying to protect their profits. The second is the court of public opinion. Even his dumb ass would be shocked if he made real moves towards this by the amount of people who protest. The economic impact would be too severe to ignore as many many Americans in high profile office jobs are on at least 1 of the mental health medications claimed to want to target. \n\nIt is scary rhetoric but there are ways to prepare, such as tapering for those that can handle it, or building up a stockpile by getting an increase from your provider while taking the same dose by either cutting pills or taking less per day (please please please seek doctor advice before going this route especially if cutting pills as not all pills can be cut and see an even decrease in dose. So please talk to your doctor if you are worried enough to consider this.) but realistically (I hope) there will not be sweeping bans of these drugs because of how devastating the economic impacts would be and the power of big pharma lobbying to protect their easy money. The only exception could be further ADHD meds shortages as the DEA can set strict limits on the number pharmaceutical companies are allowed to make per year. For those struggling to figure out how to function I recommend looking into straterra or other plant based legal stimulants (caffeine and nicotine are two decent options) as well as helpful supplements (like l-tyrosine, a dopamine precursor)and if you don't smoke looking into Wellbutrin as well which can be helpful for some ADHD patients. Of course talk to your doctor before making any of these changes yourself. Meds can be tricky and dangerous if misused and even supplements aren't always safe and might have interactions that surprise you. Like Adderall interacting with vitamin c and antacids.",

Cymbalta is way worse for you than any of the painkillers long term. People have bad liver damage, prolonged brain zaps while trying to quit, seizures, suicidal thoughts, and withdrawal.  There are studies cutrently going on to see if they have any significance in the development of dementia.  I'm not demonizing antidepressants.  I'm saying that they hand them out like candy for a drug that has quite a few side effects, some being severe, and it is quite possible that it is a money maker for the doctor and pharmaceutical companies.  This is not me saying that people shouldn't take them and they aren't useful.  I think they help people tremendously, and individuals need to weigh the risks and benefits.\n\nI'm also not trying to villify all doctors, but I have gone through quite a few of them trying to get help with my chronic illness, and several of them have offered antidepressants, while not offering to help me find counseling or a referral to a psychiatrist. I have been one of those people who lost coverage when I was younger and couldn't afford to go to a doctor and had been on antidepressants for a year that weren't helping much, but when they were gone, I definitely knew it, and I was a little pissed that I had been lied to about how non-addictive they supposedly are.",
