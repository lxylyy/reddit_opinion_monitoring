A lot of the news that comes across TikTok comes straight from other countries, and is something we wouldn’t see otherwise, since our news doesn’t report a lot of things. I know, for example, I’ve seen tons of on-the-ground footage from European and UN aid groups in Gaza, that were never shown or mentioned on US news sites.  \n\nIf TikTok, or any social media, gives someone anxiety, they should definitely stop using it, or learn to use to their advantage.

It sucks you in with addicting content and eventually you realise you can't live your day without doomscrolling for 3 hours before bed, after bed and during your commute..\n\ntiktok will also still shove content that's popular down your throat. despite blocking out keywords and flitering, I will still see occasional filth on the app. went ahead and deleted it completely. my anxiety never felt better my entire life",

It’s not perfect for sure though, if it’s best to avoid it all together then that’s just what’s best.",
