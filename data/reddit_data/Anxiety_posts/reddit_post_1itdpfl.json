Tell them they are beautiful\n\n- Stay off social media\n\n- Listen to podcasts like Limetown or Divorce Ranch while cleaning out your refrigerator or closets\n\n- Put fresh fruit in your water\n\n- Give away nice things that you don't use on buynothing\n\n- Wear fuzzy socks\n\n- Look at websites like PSTR studio and imagine where you would hang your favorite prints\n\n- Buy delicious, individually-wrapped chocolates, put them in the freezer, eat one or two every night\n\n- Host a game night\n\n- Plan to grow something this spring like a windowsill herb garden, a pot of flowers for your front door, a patch of tomato plants, etc.\n\n- If you think you can handle it, listen to Maddow's first season of Ultra -- people have tried to destroy us from the inside before and we survived\n\n- Bake cookies for someone who needs to be cheered up\n\n- Create a comforting bedtime routine\n\n- Go to a museum or a movie on a weekday\n\n- Look for ways to be kind to strangers\n\n- Watch [Jackie and Shadow and their 3 eggs](https://www.youtube.com/live/B4-L2nfGcuE?si=lZbVY_sA-QRLmVSU) live.
