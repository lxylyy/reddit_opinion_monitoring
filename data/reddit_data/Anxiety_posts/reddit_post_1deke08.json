I also went for deep tissue massages every 2-3 weeks which released stress.\nThings like chamomile, raspberry and green tea calmed me down so much before bed. \nAnd most of all, my favourite comfort books like The Walking Dead comics took me away from reality. \n\nI know those can be expensive so I pray you have the funds for this‚Ä¶.. annoyingly you do have to have some money to get your anxiety sorted, whichever way you try. \n\nI hope this helped xx",
