  "selftext": "A few days ago I made a post about not leaving the house in months. I spoke about how I was going to challenge myself to go somewhere. Guess what…. i went to my local shopping centre today and I went to a few different shops to get different things!\n\nThis is huge for me because I haven’t been to this shopping centre since August 2023, the last time I was here I felt so dizzy that I thought I was going to pass out. This is the furthest I have travelled in ages! I stayed with my mom on the phone to help me distract myself and to ensure that I didn’t feel alone. I also left the house at around 9.30 am as the shopping centre is normally very calm at this time. I spent about 20 mins in there. \n\nI just wanted to share my victory with you guys 🥹\n\nEdit: I am so overwhelmed by all of the positivity 😭 and it truly warms my heart that my post has encouraged others to try to challenge themselves with more exposure! Towards the end of last year I couldn’t even leave my BED. If I can do it, I’m almost certain that you can to! I will keep you guys updated when I make my next outing! Thanks everyone 🙂",

I gave myself a reality check, for almost a year I had this intense fear that something bad would happen to me and NOTHING has happened. \n\nIf something bad was going to happen it would have happened by now. As anxiety sufferers we catastrophize even when there might not be any logical reason to do so. \n\nI recommend gradual exposure, as I mentioned in a previous post, With the guidance of an online therapist, I would walk around my front garden and around my neighbourhood for some time to get used to being out in general. I wasn’t very consistent with this though and the last time I did this was in April of this year. Perhaps if you do it more consistently it can help tremendously when it’s time to challenge yourself to go even further.\n\nTowards the end of 2023 I was in a position where I could barely even leave my bed without hyperventilating, I couldn’t shower, brush my teeth or even go downstairs to make my own meals. If I can do you you definitely can You’ve got this! Best of luck 🙂",
