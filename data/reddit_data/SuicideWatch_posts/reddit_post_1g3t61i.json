What’s the point of trying to do something good in a world full of injustice? How can i feel good about myself when there are children in a neighboring country starving to death, burnt alive by another human and nobody cared about them at all? I can’t bear this anymore",

Negativity simply stands out more in our brains, and the news doesn't tend to report on positivity because it doesn't sell as well. I am only one person and can only affect so much, but I may as well stick around and do what little I can for others for as long as I can bear to continue staying. If others previously have shown me tiny kindnesses that changed my life for the better, why can't I do something life changing for someone, too?",

I have poor written english but i speak english everyday with the people i work with and i am considered to be fluent, i switch between english and arabic out of habit but when i need to express my feelings i use my second language because it’s emotionally less harsh on me. If you speak two languages regularly, you’d know. I also used english in this post because it was the only subreddit i came across that would allow me vent about anything and it’s an English subreddit.\n\nI live in Egypt, i have witnessed what’s happening online, i wake up everyday to check on my phone the first thing to see what happened there last night and keep an eye till the night. I didn’t go to the border. It takes compassion and sympathy to relate, but i understand if you have never been in such a situation to the point you think i am pushing propaganda when i am severely hurt with what i have been watching. I didn’t think people will notice my post, if i am trying to push a point i would have asked chatgpt at least to make it more expressive or have a better vocab or grammar, my post was poorly written because i was in such a low moment.\n\nI am interested in politics and nations and look them online often, everybody on social media uses kevin and karen, it wasn’t a way for me to describe americans, i was only describing a behavior, i didn’t mean to offend anybody.\n\nIt feels very harsh to express your very own vulnerable feelings just for someone to call it BS and lying.",
