  "selftext": "My sister walked in on me trying to take my own life. She kind of just stood there and stared at me. I stared back for a minute and my sister started saying how she knew this would happen because of the bad things I think about. I broke down and started crying in my sister's arms, and after I stopped crying she told me that she knew I was trying my best, and sometimes your best feels like your worst, she told me that she loved me and that she wanted to see me smile but some days that just isn't an option, Then she grabbed my arm and she took me outside to play in the snow and distract me, we made a snowman and god I'm so glad I got to make that damn ugly snowman. (Snowman melted though, it's unfortunate.)\n\nBut she shouldn't even know what it means to commit suicide, she's 11, and I'm 19. That is what truly hurt me, our parents educated her on suicide, what it means, and how to act if she ever sees somebody trying to kill themselves, they knew it would happen one day or another.",

I'm a teacher and you'd be surprised by how thoughtful, sensitive and sympathetic we are as kids/pre-teens. We seem to lose that with time but most students I've had were great at dealing with situations such as this naturally, in ways adults would never, and without being instructed to. Trust me, I've dealt with lots of bad stuff and my students always surprise me.",
