I can't be an adult please I can't handle it I'm afraid and stupid as hell. Please I need to be shot dead I'm not made for this world. I'm not mentally well enough to be dealing with life and it's already hard enough when you don't have mental illness so it's hell for me.\n\nNobody can help me. I've talked to people in the past and nothing anyone can say or do to help me. I'm just posted here because I like to get my thoughts written in posts.\n\n\"I'm so glad you're still here\" please stfu me being alive is not a good thing. Not having a method is so terrifying. Death is scary to me but being alive is even more scary.\n\n\"You're young things can get better\" that only makes me feel dread because things have been bad for forever I don't need to be reminder I have more of life to go.\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel backed into a corner. I'm afraid of being put in a extremely bad situation I can't handle because I won't know what to do. I think I'd be so desperate I'd do anything drastic without thinking.\n\nAlso it's hard being around my family because I'm mentally ill. They push me so easily. I self harm because of it. But I can't leave I have no money. I'll probably be living with them for a long time unfortunately.\n\nThis life is not worth living or at least my life isn't because more bad things happen to me than good things\n\nI wish I could get away. Some beautiful place far away where I don't have to worry about anything.\n\nOr maybe I wish I were dead.\n\n\"Sleep is good, death is better; but of course, the best thing would to have never been born at all.\" -Heinrich Heine",

I know you say that being alive is scarier than death, but have you ever wondered why people choose to stay alive nonetheless? It's because they find a purpose. Don't give up without a fight, at least. Try one more day - help someone else, cook a meal, research your favorite subject, talk to a friend if there is one, if not - talk to yourself, or write a diary entry. Look at the sky, the plants, the trees, a sunset, a sunrise. Does any, any of these things or someone help you feel a little bit better? I know first-hand that being let down by your family - the people who are supposed to support and love you feels like. But blood doesn't define love. Kindness, respect and integrity do that. So if you ever meet someone who gives you that, they could be your real family. In the end, life is a waiting game for someone or something better to come. It's cruel, but it is what it is. But I swear, that better people really are out there, as well as a purpose. The feelings you have, and your perspective is completely valid, because you have only seen the harsh side, so it's natural you think this way. But when you feel the kindness of a human, the comfort of a home, and eyes that see you for you, life will become the beautiful place where you don't have to worry about anything, even if for just a moment. You may be sick of hearing this, but please make it through another day. Maybe that person, or that purpose will come tomorrow. \n\nI can't promise that life will change drastically into a flower field. Change is slow, change is hard, but despite that, this world has seen change time and time again without fail, because change is inevitable too. Here is a virtual hug. Don't give up, just for today. Who knows? Change may start in the next minute.",

And as mentioned perhaps this was a rare instance where my brain was the weakest link.\n\nStill, after regularly observing and even nearly being taken in by some of the perennial grift (and other forms of dishonesty, apparently aimed at subtle influence rather than material gain) here in recent months it's obviously exasperating enough to occasionally prompt betrayal of one's more calmly circumspect judgment.  \nThis is of course the primary goal of some such activity, as it is on the net more widely: communication per se might not be effectively preventable but degradation of its efficiency and integrity can serve many of the same ends.\n\nAs someone who grew up when rather sophisticated disingenuous activity such as is now even substantially automatable was not yet nearly so pervasive relative to basically non-deceptive human traffic online, yes I probably am somewhat 'obsessed', or at least ineluctably interested, in trying to circumvent its worst effects especially in a contexts like this where the consequences of induced general distrust and/or demoralization for the most vulnerable users can be especially high.\n\nOf course being openly realistic about the questionable nature of a certain traffic subset also has its detrimental effects for the most vulnerable by tending to promote generalized suspicion on that basis, which fact is not lost on those who seek to promote conflict and chaos.  \nSo yes often enough less is more. But those who know very well what they're doing (among whom I don't mean to implicitly include OP, who was likely a 'false positive' here) should have no illusions of impunity: in the fullness of time most all that's been done in the dark will be brought to light.",
