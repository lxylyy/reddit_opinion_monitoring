But I know it‚Äôll be rough. I‚Äôm not scared. I‚Äôm not sure. I guess I just wanted to put it out there that I‚Äôm going to die before I do. So yeah. That‚Äôs it. \n\nUPDATE: I‚Äôm still alive. I ended up just riding it out alone. I took 4 different types of pills. (My antidepressant, abilify, my hdhd medication and a sleeping pill (clonidine) which can cause serious problems when ingested in doses higher than 2mg.) I knocked out shortly after I took everything and I woke up at about 5 (am). I actually didn‚Äôt get sick this time (my last attempt I felt like I was dying). As of now I feel weak and disoriented, dizzy and I can‚Äôt rlly control my body the way I want to. I don‚Äôt think I need a hospital. I‚Äôm not going to die. But thought yall deserved an update. ",
