So we've locked it and dealt with the people who just came here to argue.  \n\nFor the people who are disputing OP's statement, the key thing to keep in mind is not whether suicidal people *actually* want to die or not.  It's an unanswerable question and it's a waste of time to debate it.  The point is that anything along the lines of \"you don't want *really* want to die\" is an invalidating, counterproductive, and condescending thing to say.",
