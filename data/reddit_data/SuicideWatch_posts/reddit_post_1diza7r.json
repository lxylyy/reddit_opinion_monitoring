      "body": "I'm not sure how old you are, but it does get a bit easier. \n\nI was raped in high school after the school sent me home for having drugs I didn't have. I was searched and then when my mom couldn't get me they allowed me to go home with my then senior boyfriend, as his classes had ended. It was a pretty violent event once he got me to my house. \n\nWhen I reported to the school, the school officer and my parents, no one believed me. No one wanted to help. My mother went as far as to just get a pregnancy test and make me take it in front of her. The school officer said I couldn't report it to him and the principals and guidance counselor said there wasn't anything they could do. \n\nLife went pretty poorly after that, I didn't do well. It happened two more times after that with the last time getting some of my teeth broken. \n\nIt's okay if you're not okay all of the time. You'll probably have nightmares and flashbacks. Find someone to talk to. Don't suppress it. I suppressed it for years and it all came up unexpectedly one day 10 years later. I also constantly struggled with nightmares and was diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nYou don't really forget about it. But you move past it eventually. (It can take a lot of time) You understand there are good people in the world and there are shit people in the world. And it's difficult to be surrounded by shit people. If you can, distance helps. Talking about it helps. Even just to strangers.\n\n I'm an SA advocate and speak about my experience often, it was my way of taking hold of the situation and creating a positive. No one helped me, so I can at least help other people. \n\nPeople not being believed happens WAY more often than you think and it should and when that happens because people don't believe you, you shut up. Don't do that. Stand up for yourself when you can. \n\nI'd also recommend taking some self defense classes. I know this can be something generic but it really can help. But keep in mind even If you know self defense and you freeze up, that's okay. You didn't deserve what happened to you. And no one should have to learn self defense because of the fear of being assaulted.",

Basically a room for kids so cops could interview children. They didnt believe her whatso ever. Then to top it off the dude was then trying to stalk her, but he didn't know I was around. I started doing shit to his car, his house...fucked with his job. I made it my mission ver the course of 10yrs to make his life a living hell. I'm pretty sure I made him go insane and completely skip town. Haven't seen the dude in almost 15yrs and I was actively trying to find him. The last time I heard about him was when I was trying to lure him into an extremely remote state forest with a female friend of mine and about 4 of my big buddies to help \"dispose\" of some garbage... But they backed out and he didn't show up bc he caught wind of what was gonna go down. That was when he disappeared and I never saw him again. Was pretty hilarious how predators are so tough until they have to deal with someone who challenges them on their disgusting behavior. Was it all worth the long nights following him or waiting outside his work? Absolutely. When the police would rather bust low level drug crimes than protect innocent people from assault...you know our judicial system is screwed. I'm so sorry you had to endure all that",

The first steps the hardest but once you take it there’s nothing stopping you. There’s plenty of great ppl out there and I’m sure your gonna find someone who’ll help you",
