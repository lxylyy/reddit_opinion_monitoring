  "title": "My goodbye letter <3",
  "selftext": "Hello :) \nI am 24F, from a small country in Europe. I am writing this as I have no one to actually say goodbye to - maybe, just maybe someone will notice this so i can get a farewell. And if anyone is interested, I will talk a bit about myself, because all I wanted was for someone to care..\n\nI want no one to be sad for me, I am going content knowing I actually gave life a shot and tried my best! But I know this is the best solution :( Life is not meant for everyone and that is okay. \n\nEver since I was little I had no other purpose than to be mercilessly abused by my teachers and peers and neglected by my parents (I believe they did not mean to, so I have no hard feelings though). \nI was treated as if I was less than human. If something in the class broke, they all agreed to blame it on me. If someone didn’t wipe the board that day, they’d say I was on duty so I’d be the one punished. They’d also beat me with a chair, push me down the stairs, throw my pencils out the window, step on my clothes so they’d be dirty, throw food in my face… you get the idea. At some point kids said if you touched me, you’d get a virus that made you as stupid and ugly as I was so no one wanted to sit next to me. I get really sad when I see younger pictures of myself :( She was a sweet girl and she didnt deserve that. Every day was like walking on the battlefield, I would pray to God to take me away but he didn’t want to. I was 11 at most :( My only relief was art, anime, video games and such. Up until 15 I only had online friends on an internet forum back then, and they helped me with loneliness. \n\nHigh school was a bit better but I ended up really depressed and spent it battling an eating disorder and not living my years unlike my peers :( My parents didnt notice I was struggling even though I was losing so much weight, they were too attentive to my little brother that had some issues so he needed more help and attention which I understood. But I was left to battle everything alone with no support :( I developed depression, SH issues and an ED. I went to therapy but didn’t help much :( \n\nRight now i’m working with kids, they are cute and I love them but my workplace is really abusive and it brought me to a new low :( it’s well paid but that doesn’t help me much. I dread everyday just like I did when I was a kid. I am just living the same sh’t again and again and cannot change anything. I know if I keep on living it will just be more and more abuse as this is why i was born :( i don’t know anything else but this. \n\nLove of my life left me a while ago and he is much better without me. Im too broken to love and be loved. (D, if u ever read this know that I loved u from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry I was not a better gf for you.)\n\nSadly I cannot feel anything anymore but despair and hopelessness. I left behind all my dreams of being an artist or a sports teacher or a trainer (i really love working out) sadly I chose psychology to study and I cannot change it anymore nor study something else :( I don’t even have the energy left anymore anyway. \n\nI really hope my parents will take care of my cats, two strays I saved and raised from since they were the size of my palm. Maxine and Sissi, you kept me alive for a little more and you are the light of my life 🤍 I will remember your shiny, emerald eyes, your soft fur, and you purring on my chest as I pass away. \n\nI had so much love to give sadly I didn’t know how to give and receive , and I am also really scared of people deep down :( I dont know how to fit in and never knew. I tried to change my life inside and outside, I really tried it all. But now my soul is really worn out :( \nI would like to thank everyone who kept me alive for a little longer, anyone who ever tried even in the slightest to encourage me, and saw even the littlest potential in me. \nI am sorry I bit like a scared dog the hands of people who tried to help because I couldn’t distinguish anymore who was and who wasn’t well-meaning. I am so sorry :( I have many regrets in this life too, all them being I wasn’t a better person to the very little people who loved me. In my last moments, I hope they can forgive me and visit my grave or think about me from time to time. I am sending everyone so much love and gratitude, it was a difficult journey and a really painful one too. I think my soul has learned a lot in this painful lifetime. But it is enough. \n\nMom, Dad, I love you. I forgive you for not being there for me. I hope you can forgive me too. My dear cats, I love you. My beloved ex bf, I forgive you for leaving and i’ll always love you. The friends I had and left, i’ll cherish the memories. And everyone who took their time to read until the end, thank you! Goodbye everyone! \n\n",

I think infact I’m almost certain she didn’t realise how much pain she left behind, and how desperately loved, needed, cherished and wanted she was. I loved her more than I love myself. She was bright, clever, funny, sensitive, beautiful, kind and the most selfless person I know. My life and the life of my family will forever be changed and I will carry this to my grave. The would ofs, could ofs, should ofs, play in an endless loop in my head. I would never want any parent, sibling or other family member to have to go through such agonising pain like this. I know you’ve heard it said, it’s a temporary problem with a permanent “ solution”\nI am 54, I too have felt like just going snd ending it all, but then I regain my senses and realise how many people this would hurt and cause pain to, and I also remember how life is a series of ups and downs ( sometimes very down I know) but there truly is a hope for a brighter tommorow. Please hear me, I am not in any way a counsellor ( far from it!) but I am old enough to have known and lost love several times but always,always,always there’s another chance. And remember that this pain will try and isolate you to be alone, just you and your thoughts, please fight this. I know you’re tired, but fight on and reach out to someone ( Samaritans or just someone you know will listen) because I guarantee you your pain is not too heavy or dark for another to listen to and guide you. I promise you a brighter day will come, a new life will unfold, and it is within your grasp. I care, I care that you live. I believe in you and I believe that good things are ahead for you. But, you must, must reach out to at least one other, right now you are actually blinded by your pain, it causes you to think the worst and it isn’t the truth. You are beautiful, I can sense that my your writing, you are worthy to be loved, you have every right to be respected and heard and you will be surprised at how just talking things through with someone will help. I’ve been there and scoffed when people told me talking to others helped, it was my pain, my private dark pain but once I opened up but by bit it’s spell over me was broken. This is about you.
