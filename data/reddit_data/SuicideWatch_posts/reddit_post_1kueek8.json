I'm overweight and have a small cock.\n\nLast week, I came across a hooker website and saw someone who was really exotic and had massive curves. I just thought that since I was impatient, and wanted to lose it to someone special it was better now than never.\n\nI worked hard to save up 400 for half an hour, and shaved myself so I'd be clean for her. I was early.\n\nShe was hot. Easily the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I went in, and got to the foreplay. We both tried our best but fuck, I couldn't even get hard. And before I knew it 30 mins were up. I had to put on my clothes and leave. She was really nice about it, and tried to tell me positive things about me and my body image so I wasn't discouraged but I know I fucked it up. I paid 400 just to fondle a pair of boobs.\n\nI just got home and started crying. I thought of killing myself cause of how badly I bottled it. The woman of my dreams ready to fuck me and I couldn't even get hard. I had 1 fucking job. 1 fucking job. Get hard and put it in and I had to fuck it. I'm fucking useless. I dunno what to do to improve myself now and make sure I don't screw it up the next time, whoever wants to fuck this useless piece of fat shit. The fuck do I do with my life now, or should I just end it",

A stronger heart and higher testosterone means better erections, plus losing weight makes it look bigger and being in better shape means you can use it better.\n\nPlenty of guys are still virgins at that age, but I feel like there's not many guys at 20 who either have the income level or the discipline to save up $400 so I mean you've already got that going for you, plus you had the self awareness to say \"this is something I want, I'm gonna do something about it\".\n\nI know it will be almost impossible to see until you finally get the monkey off your back but I promise you, it's not like a life changing thing. When it's over you'll be the same guy, just having busted a nut with somebody else so try your best not to hype it up so much in your mind.\n\nI'd say in the meantime, maybe look into therapy.

Not only the memory of her presence (I'm very happy for you that you got to be with her, even just for 30 minutes -- that's awesome!), but what she told you. Those positive things about you and your body image. That shows you what a beautiful person sees in you. People who are beautiful do not get beautiful as if by magic -- they live it, see it, inward and outwardly, and what she told you is really how she, a woman of your dreams, saw you.\n\nFor you, there is great potential. I agree with her, do not be discouraged.\n\nHaving a limp dick -- frankly -- is the result of many lifestyle behaviors you have going on, almost certainly. If you use porn or watch porn regularly, there's your #1 culprit. It's to the point where like a third or more young men or some outrageous proportion are having erectile issues because of their porn use. And porn use is not just the only culprit. \n\nIt's really about dopamine. If you are depleting your dopamine through other means like eating fried foods/a lot of sugar and carbs, not sleeping well, playing a lot of video games or watching YouTube or things like that for many hours everyday. Well. Biologically, it clinches off your ability to feel pleasure. That makes getting hard...very hard. It also raises your nervousness and anxiety, and increases the negative thoughts in your head. Also making the moment for sex, when it comes, full of stuff you don't actually want to be there -- you just want to lose yourself in fucking, not that other stuff!\n\nThe good news is, with time, you can recover these things. Everyday that you work on living into your healthiness and happiness, you become healthier and happier. It is thankfully that simple.\n\nOne day, if you wished to try this again -- say, after a couple months of a dopamine detox, you would have a much different and likely happier time.\n\nI'd say, go get a move on that! If you wanted to try with her again, and have the ability to save up for her again, I'd give yourself another shot when you're in a much better place. Get a move on that while you both are still young and hot! :)\n\nAll the best of you, including the good sex that is absolutely available to you.",
