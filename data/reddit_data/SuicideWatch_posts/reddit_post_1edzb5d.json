  "selftext": "random account. \n\nI’m 17, 5 months ago I self discovered myself as a pedophile, I looked at all the online resources  to figure everything a pedophile does, what occurs and the warning signs. I was determined to find out \n\nI was confused and stressed out and I still am because before that I was perfectly fine but sometimes it could occur later in puberty. \nIt didn’t make sense, I liked girls my age and older so for that to happen was sad. \n\nNever looked at cp, but my inhibitions feel weak, I’m pushing through it. after finding out that it was true, I took meds to see if It could go away forever, ssris and sleep stuff. I’m on  40mg of Prozac. It still is happening and I have a high sex drive. I wanna try something to get rid of my libido. \n\nI knew pedophiles stared at kids, and thought to myself i would never do that. But it manifested \nI do long stares at kids, no thoughts just \n compulsion and repressed thoughts that form nothing. I just want it to stop because I want to go back to normal I’m still 17 I want to live life.\n\nI’ve been turned by  thoughts, but I feel super ashamed. it’s only happened 8 times.  \n\nI feel so unlucky to be born that way, everything was going awesome and I had to born a pedophile. If I could find a fix. I would do it immediately. \n\nFeel free to ask questions.\n\nUpdate: \nI for sure know that I am one now. I don’t know what to do, like  I’m trapped everyday. It never goes away, I panic frequently. And the thought of what I once was makes me depressed. I was normal before. Now I’m just dealing with something forever. Like it’s just compulsion, I want to relax and forget about everything. Haven’t watched CP at all or ever intend to. That’s been easy. I have an unlucky life. Please help",

One is evil – he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.”\n \n He continued, “The other is good – he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you – and inside every other person, too.”\n \nThe grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf will win?”\n \nThe old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.”\n\n—-\n\nYou are young, you haven‘t offended. Nurish all the aspects of your personality that you would attribute to the Good Wolve inside of you. Identify the things in your live that would feed the Bad Wolve and avoid them.",

Have you ever tried to, or almost did? You say no thoughts form when you stare at the kids. That's where I'm confused. Have you ever visually imagined doing something to a kid. I remember reading or watching something where a real perv said he'd picture what any child he saw looked like with no clothes in. Also what age are we talking here? You are still a minor so if we're talking like 14/15 years olds I wouldn't be too concerned. If we're talking like under 13 then yeah okay that's a problem.  It's a sickness. Something malformed in your brain. It's doesn necessarily mean you're a bad person. Unless you act on your bad thoughts. I believe you can be helped in therapy. It sounds like you're already resisting and that's why your mind draws a blank when you stare at kid. That's a good sign.

Maybe therapy works for you, but maybe by the end you're still a pedophile. That's genuinely fine and doesn't make you a bad person.\n\nPeople often conflate fetishes and sexual fantasies with intent and morality, which I find to be a stupid sentiment tainted by societal notions of purity. Many people have fucked up kinks, and it doesn't matter if a person does or doesn't have said kink, it matters if they actually do fucked up shit. Lots of people have a rape kink. It's pretty common. Most of those people aren't rapists. \n\nI'm not gonna encourage you to foster your latent pedophilia, but also continually trying to repress it without success will only serve to increase your chances of actually abusing someone.

Also: 17 is a very wild, hormonal, young, confusing age - even if you WERE a pedofile - it could change or weaken - and the intensity would likely drop significantly in near future.

Late teens and early-mid-twenties are full of changes, intense and uncalculatable. Sounds like something old people say but I noticed it myself.
