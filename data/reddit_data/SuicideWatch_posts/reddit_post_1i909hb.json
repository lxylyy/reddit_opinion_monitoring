I'm going to be honest I was at first but honestly, it was like a summer camp but with more rules. Girls and boys are in separated dorms, daily group activities, music, recreation. In my state the longest they can keep you is 2 weeks. Which sounds long but once you get adjusted after a couple of days it goes by pretty quickly! \nFor some people they actually do get the help that they need. A small step into making things just a little more bearable... If you were to go now at your age, it will be a lot better than going as an adult.",
