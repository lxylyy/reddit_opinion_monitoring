A \\*good\\* therapist will not be scared of your SI. We know it‚Äôs a coping mechanism, we also know how to help find healthier coping mechanisms, and we know how to normalize ideation.‚Ä¶it‚Äôs actually very normal. You should be able to let all your crazy fly with your therapist. If you get any judgmental vibes, find a different therapist. It‚Äôs literally their  job as a therapist, to help you through your batshit insanity, and they‚Äôve heard or studied all of it. Unfortunately, not all therapists are good at their job, but you should be able to get a sense of that pretty easily. I would be honest in the initial phone call about your level of suicidality, because some wont work with you if you‚Äôre suicidal simply because they dont have the right skill set to help, most will though. Also, keep in mind, therapists are extremely compassionate empathetic people who have dedicated their lives to helping you through mental health struggles. Very often, recovery from their own mental health issues is what brought them to the field, so you should not be faced with anything other than deep care and understanding. Definitely not something to be scared of.",

It's not exactly fun, but it's not really bad either. It's mostly just really boring. You'll spend most of your time there going to group therapy sessions and meeting with various medical and mental health specialists. They'll almost certainly put you on medication and will frequently assess you to see how you're doing. \n\nIf you are potentially going to be hospitalized, don't panic. They won't put you in a straight jacket and lock you in a padded room (the hospital I went to doesn't even use physical restraints, even in the most extreme cases) my best advice is to make the most of your time there, learn coping skills and do a lot of introspection, most hospitals will provide you with a journal and a pen if you ask for it. I'd also recommend bringing a few books you enjoy and to pack comfy clothes, though if they have drawstrings they won't let you have them. Some hospitals even allow you to bring stuffed animals, though the hospital i went to didn't. You'll be allowed to see your family or friends during visiting hours, and they'll likely set you up with therapy and medication management once you discharge.\n\nI understand it can seem daunting and scary, but try to look at it as a positive.
