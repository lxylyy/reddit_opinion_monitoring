  "selftext": "I‚Äôll always love you babygirl. This last cheating is my last straw. I‚Äôve been in constant pain due to a spinal cord injury in 2008. It killed my social life and I haven‚Äôt been able to do much of anything since then. In 2011 I thought my time had come. I met my wife of 15 years and told myself to stick around for her; she‚Äôd be worth it. I truly believe she my soulmate and that‚Äôs the only reason this hurts so deeply, so completely. True despair comes when you thought you were most happy. Two years after we got married her gmom passed and she‚Äôs been off the rails since. Serial cheating isn‚Äôt enough of a description to put a label on what she‚Äôs done. She‚Äôs s*xually abused me numerous times. Physical, mental, emotionally has abused me more times than I can count. It‚Äôs an actual smalll miracle she hasn‚Äôt given either of us an STI or worse. \n\nI‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù 260 mostly muscle and NO ONE has believed my abuse. She‚Äôs 5,2 250. Every time I open up about it I‚Äôm laughed at and not believed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a marine (ret) how can anyone abuse you?!?!‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôve not taken this lightly and this is NOT a cry for attention. Let my passing serve as an example of abuse can happen within ANY relationship. \n\nMom I pray I see you on the other side with grandmom. Dad, if you ever see this None of this is your fault. You‚Äôre the best dad I could ever wish for. None of this is your fault daddy. None. \n\nI‚Äôm 42 in constant physical pain and not having another surgery. \n\n(Spouse) I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt satisfy your whims of threesomes etc. Who you are today is not the woman I married and sacrificed everything for. And yet‚Ä¶I still love\nYou. I always will. I wish I could‚Äôve helped you more than I did. Goodbye. \n\nIn the end it doesn‚Äôt matter who did what anymore. Just that I can‚Äôt go on with this hurt. \n",
