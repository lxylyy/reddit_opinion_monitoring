Planning on going out in the woods and shooting myself twice in the chest and once in the head, should be enough to end it without the possibility of surviving. \n\nI remember being a kid full of hopes and dreams, going outside to play with a stick and pretending to be an astronaut while swinging on a vine. Never would have thought it would get to this point. \n\nDisowned from my entire family due to my lack of religious belief, no friends, no partner, no job, no hobbies, nothing. There is no point in life, there is no reason to continue when you‚Äôve lost before you ever began. \n\nIt‚Äôs almost comedic how tragic and catastrophic my life has been. Well, goodbye Reddit. People on Reddit were nicer to me than anyone in my real life was. ",
