I just feel like I've come to a point where I've experienced enough pain that I'm numb to this life. I don't want to be alive, but I don't want to die. I don't know what comes after this. It could be worse than this hell. \n\nI consider ending my life but then I think about the aforementioned.  \n\nI don't care about my job. I don't care if I lose it. I don't care if I don't survive.  This reality has drained me of the person I used to be. I used to like helping people. I used to like hanging out with friends. Now all I feel is pain. Every second of every day.  \n\nThis hellhole did this to me. I wish I never existed.  Existence is a curse for so many people in this place. Why is this place like this?\n\nI don't know what to do. I am crying as I'm typing this. \n\nI hate feeling like this. ",

In an alternate reality I'd probably make an effort, I'd be happy to go back to my old friend, but right now I really just don't care. And anytime I feel myself starting to care I get angry at myself. I just want it all to end. I'm scared of what comes next, too, but the way I'm so checked out of my life, I don't find it feasible for me (or for anyone who has the misfortune of knowing me) to still keep going.",

It‚Äôs just the side effect of whatever our societies prioritize at a particular time.\n\nI think the current times are hyper focused on being the best. People, tech, trends, money, etc moves too fast now and days and it doesn‚Äôt promote people to rest and appreciate their surroundings. It‚Äôs hard to come together with loved ones because everyone seems to be just as stress, depressed and busy because we are always scrabbling to get our basic needs met. I wish our world leaders and our communities would see this and resist this over-work, self-indulgent culture but ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt quit your job just yet seeing that it seems like that would be a warning sign that you are closer to ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù and *I* do not want that for you. I understand that you don‚Äôt have the self survival motivation right now but how about you set a little challenge for yourself this month. Maybe use a bit of *a* paycheck to do something for a local community. i.e: making sandwiches for a homeless shelter, buying laundry detergent and giving it to a local veteran center, etc. Something to reignite that giving/helping nature within you. \n\nI would also recommend getting medication to help with your seemingly depressive symptoms and outlook. That and a lifestyle change and focus. \n\nI‚Äôm about to swap out social media (including YouTube) for books again for healthy escapism. Just pick genres that excite and inspire you. Something positive and adventurous to open your mind up again. I use to have a healthier outlook on life even during getting abused and neglected as a child because I had books that helped me escape. \n\nI‚Äôm glad you shared, you aren‚Äôt alone. Stay with us.",
