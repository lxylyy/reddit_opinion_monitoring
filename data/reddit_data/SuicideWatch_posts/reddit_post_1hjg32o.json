  "selftext": "I have memories from as far back as I can recall of being molested by my father. I used to sleep with my parents when I was little. Every night he would put his hands inside my pant and rub my vagina. He would make me hold his dick. Sometimes he'd get on top of me, take off my shirt and put his mouth on my breasts that weren't even developed yet. I was younger than 8 years old. He would try to push himself into me but it didn't completely penetrate most probably because it would take a lot of force and mom would wake up. I used to wake up in the middle of this but I absolutely froze, I never screamed or pushed him. In the morning he'd tell me that sometimes when he's sleepy, he confuses me for my mom. Again, I was a preadolescent child. \n\nI never told a soul. I'm to scared of the aftermath. I'm afraid my mom won't believe me, or worse, she knew all along but never did anything to stop it. I'm 20 now and still living with my parents. He thinks that I've forgotten everything and we live as if we're a happy family. But every night for years I break down crying and contemplating suicide.\n\nI'm set to move out by next year but I don't think I'll be able to last that long. I have grown up to be a very insecure, emotional, anxious, depressed, and self destructive person. I have severe social anxiety and can't function well in society. I have managed to find a job that will get me out of this house but I don't think I'll be able to live alone in this condition. I do have a loving boyfriend who knows all this and is very supportive. But I don't see a future with him due to some other reasons (one of them being my mental health). I've tried therapy but it didn't help. I've gotten very close to suicide attempts in the past but so far I've been too coward to go through it. I just want to end it and it feels like nothing matters anymore.",
