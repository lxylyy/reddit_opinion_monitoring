I have spent my entire life fighting to feel decent about myself but nothing has gotten better. There is no place for me here, and I wish I realized that earlier. Some people are just not meant to be on this earth. I am miserable every single day and no matter what I do it'll never change. I wish I killed myself as a child so I could have gone in peace. Now I have so many responsibilities and so much guilt. Things are never getting better and the opportunity I had to leave before everything became too much is gone. I know I can't go back in time but I regret it so, so much. I wish I killed myself when I was a child. I had no idea that I would be so angry at myself over this. I thought things would get better. I wish I killed myself when I was a child.",

My family who is forced to interact with me absolutely hate me, they have said to my face that they hate me and my mother cries because of everything I have done to myself. There is nowhere in the world where I am going to fit it or be welcome and no chance I am ever going to be happy with myself because every time I'm happy with myself it causes hurt to other people. At my very best I am someone most people are able to ignore but most of the time I am a burden to deal with and there's nothing I can do to change it, just who I am. I have tried to change. I am going to be miserable no matter what I do or who I am so there's no point sticking around.",

There is never late to just leave somewhere else where you can be happy while avoiding those that aren't healthy for you. \n\nBut again, this world is pretty big, do you know how life is in Colombia, Japan, Belgium? You have your reasons but also try to think more logically about the options this life has to offer. Many times we feel limited by money or people that are close to us but that doesn't mean that our lives are automatically limited by them.\n\nI still don't know why you're a burden specifically but again, if you want to really pursue your own happiness, you won't be a burden to anyone, and fuck even if you end up as a burden for someone, why do you care so much if that person might not have done much for your life. Remember, its your life, you're the one that decides what to do with it, and sure, there are external our of our hands things that heavily affect them, but not forever and not for everything.\n\nPersonally, I decided on living a life of melancholy because of things that I didn't choose to get in this life but I got because life is unfair and I can't never be able to change that, BUT, there's still plenty of things in this world to do, experience, learn, that you're not seeing because of shitty people in your life.",
