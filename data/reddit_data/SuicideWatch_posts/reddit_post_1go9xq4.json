  "selftext": "I have a 100 bottle of extra strength tylenol, a 100 tablet of 200mg ibuprofen, ~20 duel pain relievers mixed with tylenol and ibuprofen, and about 10 antibiotics. I just got back from the store with my favorite snacks. I have a can of margarita 10%. I just tried to call the people in my suicide note but i didn't get an answer. I guess this is it. I just went to the store and got a razor blade, but i punked out of using it. I guess if I get in too much pain i'll use it. This may be painful and I may start to stroke and seize, but fuck it. I always thought I would live till 56 (lots of diseases run in the family Im just being realistic), but I guess 21 is best. The last thing I have is my looks, so I guess I'll leave a beautiful corpse\n\nGuy's i didn't go through with it. when i posted this i had the pills and liquor open and was crying between the putting the pills in my hand and actually putting them in my mouth. i tried this before on a lessor scale and ended up violently sick in the hospital. This was way harder than doing it before, i was almost having flashbacks. I got the pills in my mouth then got scared and went back to google to see if i knew how much it took before the seizures start, if they were painful, and the likelihood of slipping into a coma. i then looked up the most successful suicide attempts and pills were ranked at the lowest. then i started reading your comments about how it wouldn't kill me but make me violently sick. i have a very high pain tolerance but the last overdose was my first 10 pain until i caught covid. I did chicken out. I'm sorry if I wasted your time and energy worrying about me. I also want you to know this isn't ragebait, this did happen and I didn't see how much attention this got as my alt page with the notifications disabled. Sorry again",
