NOW!\n\nBlackmail, extortion, possession and distribution of sexual material involving minors, intent to falsely accuse of sexual assault, those girls are VILE!\n\nIt is sad how thousands of teenagers are in your position, regardless of gender (more girls in general, but that's not the point). Do not hurt yourself. Do not blame yourself. It's disgusting what is happening to you.\n\nAnd do not care about them. Don't feel bad about how \"you ruin their lives\". They are criminals and horrible human beings. There is no age to start being a piece of shit. They have no excuse.\n\nPOLICE! IMMEDIATELY! NO MATTER WHAT! DON'T ANSWER THEM, DON'T CONTACT THEM!\n\nNOW! NOW! NOW! IT IS URGENT!\n\nEDIT and keep us updated if possible. I know sometimes during an investigation the police might limit what you are allowed to say online, even anonymously, but as soon as possible, we'd like to hear back from you. Stay safe\n\nEDIT2: In the moment, your parents might get angry with you, tell you things like \"how stupid can you be\", please do not take it at heart. I don't know the relationship you have with them, but even the most loving and understanding parent can have this sort of answer. They feel stressed, they feel powerless, they feel guilty. They have all kind of scenarios in their head, they get worried, they lash out. Do not ever use that response in that moment to think \"I knew it, I'm a failure and a disappointment, they hate me\". Please. Do not be afraid of talking to them, do not feel shame. You need support. \n\nI know myself and I can see myself telling my kid they've been stupid. I'd still be proud that they took the decision to denounce and speak up and so glad they would talk to me about it and ask for my support. Mistakes do not define you. A stupid mistake doesn't make you stupid for life. And regardless, you're the victim here anyway, you don't ever have to blame yourself.\n\nIf for any reason you cannot trust your parents or another adult in your family, any other responsible adult will do. A teacher, a coach, a social worker, etc. Still go to the police regardless.",
