  "selftext": "It was back in 2021. He was a great friend, had a wife and kids. He‚Äôd always struggled with mental health and was honest about it, but towards the end he really hid what was going on. \nHe told us he was going on a trip with friends, but he booked a hotel and took all of his medication. He died. It was pretty horrible.\n\nAt the time I couldn‚Äôt understand how he could do that, especially to his wife and kids.\nBut I get it now. \nI‚Äôm too scared to overdose because of the horror stories, but it worked for him. \n\nI wish there was an easy way out that didn‚Äôt make everyone around you hate you. It sucks.\n",
