  "selftext": "I'm glad that I had a relatively good childhood, normally being a child means that you get to see the good part of the world, you are innocent, you are protected, people care about you, you don't have to work.\n\nBut no one warns you about growing up, you suddenly are supposed to adapt and smile at how things work in the world, you have to accept that you are going to be a slave and if you don't do it you are mentally ill, homeless or you are going to prison. I believe that people who love their jobs or their dream has always been to work as X job are brainwashed people. Jobs nowadays demand too much hours of labor and pay the bare minimum to survive/not even that, so isn't that slavery? \n\nI'm a young adult not processing the fact that I'm spending the little time in earth that I have working like a slave while rich people have perfect lives due to being born rich, nepotism or luck. \n\nI know I will get burnout but why are not people burnout enough to actually go against this system? Humans are not meant to work so much, there are people that are not working, why can't hours be shared with this people so that we all worked less? And you'll tell me something like well companies can't pay so many workers but if those workers (that previously weren't working nor making money) had money then they could buy more from these companies and so on, idk, maybe this is stupid thinking, idk anything about economy.\n\nAs I was saying I do not believe that humans are meant for this nor work the same job for 50 years, I cannot believe that this is the only system that works, I know that there must be another one. My dream is that in the future people look back and see this era as hell bc everything will have progressed so much that they can't fanthom living our horrible lives.\n\nI was looking for other ways to make money but in this generation it looks like you have to make a clown out of yourself on social media or be super talented which I'm not compared to the incredible people that has filled all the niches, there aren't any gaps left for me.\n\nTherefore, I will have to die. I don't want to stain my good childhood and teenage years with slavery. Life has been good, it only goes downhill from here. I tried to talk about this with other people but they are too far gone into the system, they have been brainwashed and truly believe they will be happy in this system. I feel like I'm going crazy. In order to inmortalize my life as a good one and prevent suffering I will have to do it soon as I'm in my last year of university.\n\nA hug to y'all.\n",

I just slowly came to the realization that even if I hated how things are, it IS how things are. I can wish they weren't, or I can do what makes me happy in that system.

I work 40 hours a week mon-tgurs 8am-6pm, office is 9 minutes from our home. So i get 3 day weekends every weekend, and.my fisnve works 100% from home.

I am very fortunate, and I remind myself of that every day. My disease is in remission, I'm getting married despite never wanting to previously. I've been able yo get put of debt, save and invest. My story is a good one, as we here far more worse then good now day.

We had no option) we are lower to middle class. No help. No welfare. I get Medicare only.

Art job, selfless job, vibes job, or hedonism (iffy on this one but it beats a dirt nap). \n\nSo art stuff, spread good stuff to the world and hope what you make makes a better society in some small way even if it just makes it more fun. Selfless stuff is like teaching or emt or firefighters like that type of stuff, doctors, directly helping people with stuff. And vibes would just be like mountain tour guide or run a surf rental shack on a beach somewhere, big chilling through life. Hedonism is self explanatory, somebody's gotta run the strip clubs and do drugs and stuff, have fun, dont hurt nobody including yourself. \n\n\n\nThat was a bit off topic but that's what I concluded. For music specifically, I do not have any great insights, it's a fucking tough beat if youre not one of the anointed few. My interaction with that world is through composers, who are generally either broke or millionaires. I found a way to do art that pays pretty well but if it fell through I'd probably go try and teach. Anything you can do to share goodness with the world, be it professional music or teaching kids scales, will keep your soul alive. \n\nIf it's any consolation, we're all broke in this generation, I never plan to retire, it just is what it is and I'm gonna try to do as much good as I can while I'm here, I wanna make dope shows people love and gets em thinking, and if that means struggling so be it. Just go down my list in your thoughts/plans. Art fails, try to give back, if that fails, try to chill and just spread good vibes, and if all else fails, selling all your shit and moving to the Bahamas or something to bartend is always an option. Beats the other other option!",
