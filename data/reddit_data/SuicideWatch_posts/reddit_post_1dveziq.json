Forcing kisses on my lips, having his hand wander and caress my leg when I was in the front passenger seat next to him in the car. Watching me sleep on the couch and wake up to him staring at me. Constantly saying I‚Äôm fat and critiquing anything I‚Äôd make to eat. It really planted seeds of self hatred for myself and depression. My mom and her sisters apparently had to deal with that sort of stuff while growing up and they always said ‚Äòthat‚Äôs just how he is‚Äô. He had them walking around in bikinis when he would have friends over to play cards. I just want to tell you it gets better. He will die and things will be ok. Not sure of your age but you can separate yourself from him once you are of age and never have to deal with him again. That‚Äôs what I did. I refused to go to family events if my grandfather would be there. If it was a major holiday, I would go but act like he wasn‚Äôt there and not acknowledge his presence. It really does get better. Of all things to leave this world over- don‚Äôt let him be the reason you do it. If you ever need to talk, I‚Äôm always here, friend.",
