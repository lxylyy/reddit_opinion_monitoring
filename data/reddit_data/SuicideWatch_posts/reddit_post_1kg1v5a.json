Depression itself is as deadly as any other terminal illness. It is never a choice to \"*end your own life and leave everyone you love behind*\" but it is the result of being stuck in a situation with no other perceived - sometimes even objectivly - viable means to escape from your pain & worries. No one is going to forgive your overwhelming debts *(as an example)* because you are suicidal.\n\nYou dont get any breaks in society for being depressed - in contrast - cancer patients gets lots of sympathy for their situation. The ones judging suicidal people are the ones who havent experienced that amount of mental anguish themselves. As it is very common in society for people to shame the deceased who was \"weak and selfish\" in their opinion.\n\nYou dont commit suicide, you die of depression. It builds little by little over time, often over many years. Until it becomes unbearable. Pessimistic outlooks on life is not attractive for partners nor does it make it easier to make any friends. Depression ruins everything in your life slowly. Until you are left like a shell of your former self. It feels like your soul and personality died long before your body gets to leave. Yet it is expected of you to still function in your day-to-day life.\n\nA cancer patient can love their partner very much and still die from it. It is exactly the same way with depression. It is not a choice but a result of untreated unbearable pain. I am 100% that your partner loved you very much and I am sorry for your loss.",
