But instead I‚Äôm a fucking pussy.    \nStop telling me to be strong. Stop commending my resilience. Stop telling me I can‚Äôt give up. Stop telling me I have to keep pushing forward.   \nI am fucking tired. I want to find peace, tranquility.  \nI can‚Äôt take this hellscape called life much longer.  \nI try and I try and I try but I still get pushed down, demonized, shit on, never enough. Never good enough. Never smart enough. Never pretty enough. Never trying hard enough.     \nI know I‚Äôm not the best person but I try fuck I FUCKING TRY SO HARD TO BE GOOD. AND IT MEANS NOTHING.   \nMaybe it‚Äôs for the better I have nobody anymore.   \nMaybe soon I‚Äôll get the balls and not give a fuck how I go out as long as I go out.    \nI understand why my mom and her sister both killed themselves now. I really, really do.  ",
