I am not interested in participating in the genetic lottery ruled by hormones & socializing know as \"the human experience\"\n\nWe are literally all shallow apes that are simply searching for the best fuck to get the best offspring, then half of us look for the best pushover to raise the best fucks kid. It truly doesn't go deeper than that. There are plenty of sidequests along the way sure, but the fundamental path we are set on by our biology is pretty much decided at birth.\n\nModern concepts of love and romance are just shit we made up to try and collectively gaslight society into keeping our animalistic side deeply buried, and the fucked up part is, it worked. It worked so goddamn well, that we actually believe we are better than animals. We just aren't lol. We ARE animals. A little smarter than our peers, sure, and we have a little less hair than our cousins, but we are fundamentally the same.\n\nNo one is honest with themselves or others. All you have to do is observe someone's behavior, listen to what they say, and you quickly realize that something is VERY FUCKED UP HERE. Why are people so unhappy? Why are suicide rates climbing? Why are people contradicting themselves from the day they're born to the day they die?\n\nBecause we are all a bunch of mindfucked, repressed monkeys that don't understand why we feel so miserable. It's really that simple.\n\nHumanity is ugly. People are fundamentally stupid on average. They go through every hoop to always be right or save their ego or believe what they want to believe regardless of new information. They don't know how to think. They only know that they feel a certain way and nothing else matters. You selfish braindead fucks. They aren't concerned with truly understanding other people: they're more interested in putting themselves on a pedestal and damning any negative behavior from others and classifying them as irredeemable. They aren't interested in empathizing: they're interested in projecting their own emotions on someone elses experience, and they genuinely think they're a good person for it, declaring themselves \"empaths\" and participating in this disgusting masturbatory ego trip while patting themselves on the back for emotionally splooging all over themselves. Fucking yikes.\n\nI hate all of you. I hope one day you see the world from where I see it now and you realize how utterly shit you are. Everyday I dream of not waking up. I always hope that one of our sociopathic overlords hits the big red button and resets technology. I don't want to be here. You are not good people and neither am I.",

Humans are social species, but are separate individuals, which of course affects the way we operate. \n\nLet's assume, if we take the individual as the main thing, we will have a place where individuals can do everything without limits, an irregular and chaotic bunch. But then it is certain that we will not completely live alone but in groups, because we have social behavior. And of course there will be conflict and war, it's just a part of nature, it is not created and it is just....there. But if we put society first, and people follow the majority, we will have an easy to manage and safer life, but individuals will be limited.\n\nHumanity is an animal, agree. We're basically the same, I agree. But if we go deeper, it becomes clear that everyone is different. We are all different, if not in appearance then in the way of thinking, or experience. What makes humans different from other animals is that we have language, speech, the ability to think, compassion....etc etc. It's just a result of evolution, it's just there. And I'm saying humans are \"different\", not \"better\" than other animals, this depends on the individual we want to talk about.\n\nAnd clearly we have the ability to think, so the meaning of life is not just about fucking and breeding. I don't really understand the concept of \"modern love\", so I won't say much about it. I will just say that from my perspective, love is a blend of both human invention and primitive instinct (biological).\n\nEverything has its good and bad sides. If you are part of a group, you must respect the rules and behave within the group's norms/ rules that based on the majority of individuals in that group. The downside of society is that individuals who are different will easily be eliminated. This is why most people these days try to fit in, to be part of the majority, and this is why they have to deceive others and themselves. \n\nThese things make us conflict with each other, and not only with each other but also with ourselves. Living within a standard framework makes us feel like we are puppets being pulled on strings, it is a double-edged sword, both protecting us and causing us misery. We feel miserable because we feel limited, and uncertain. Because we don't know where to find happiness, and because we think the purpose of life is happiness.\n\nWe get lost when searching for what is called right and wrong in this word. But in my opinion, there is nothing really right or wrong. Just like no one is truly good or bad.\n\nI'm not even sure what I'm babbling about, and these are just my thoughts. So don't believe it completely.",

Modern technology has really thrown a wrench in that with how isolated and falsely connected we can be. Because we are still animals at the end of the day we need some degree of visceral feedback to get us thinking socially. But I still see that social urge playing out in the people around me everyday.\n\nAll this is to say we are a bunch of stupid, sad, naked apes, desperately trying to find a way to just be okay from one day to the next.
