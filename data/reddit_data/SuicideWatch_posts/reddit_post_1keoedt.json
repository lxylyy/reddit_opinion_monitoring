I’ve been dealing with my symptoms for over 13 years so trust me when I say my GP & I have ruled out all other options, as has the department dealing with me, ironically, yet they don’t want to give it to me. \n\nIt is my GP’s medical opinion that the only option I have left is surgery + whilst I’m not a medical professional, I do know my body + I agree. I’m tired of taking bc + 272828 million other medications. I hate Oxycodone. I hate dihydrocodeine. I hate morphine. I hate tramadol. I hate gabapentin. I hate diclofenac. There’s so many more but I hate them all and I hate what they do to my body. \n\nOnly recently did they agree to perform the lap, but of course because nothing is ever straight forward in my life it came with a caveat. Whilst I understand the importance of what they’re requesting, it’s virtually near impossible to do what they want me to do pre surgery. I had being trying as much as I could anyway & now I’m over it. They also haven’t offered me any kind of support in trying to do this thing either lol surprise surprise. My GP is the only good one + I’ll forever be appreciative for all he’s done for me, but it’s just not enough anymore.",
