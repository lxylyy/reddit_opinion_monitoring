And so humiliated and tired. \n\nETA: he‚Äôs known her since she was 13. She was friends with my kids. Hence, groomer. \n\nEdit 2: I get it, I should leave. She‚Äôs a legal adult. Yeah, yeah. \n\nWe both have VERY public jobs in a VERY small town. Blowing this up would be humiliating for us all. Should I? Yes! Will I? I‚Äôm not strong enough. Hence, this post. ",
