  "selftext": "This is a bit explicit\n\nI only just turned 16. This happened a few days ago. I was drunk. The whole time I was telling him to stop and I was saying ‚Äúit hurts‚Äù and ‚Äúcan you please stop‚Äù. I never consented in the first place. When he pushed me onto the bed and started doing it I was crying and telling him I didn‚Äôt want to get pregnant. So to shut me up he put on a condom and told me to be quiet. I was sobbing the whole time and looked down and noticed he took the condom off and I started telling him I didn‚Äôt want a kid at 16. He just told me to shut the fuck up and ‚Äúbe a good girl‚Äù. I tried telling him that I don‚Äôt like doing sexual things with guys because when I was a kid I was sexually abused by a close family friend for a period in my life and he didn‚Äôt care and kept going which scared me. I asked him if I can give him head instead because it hurts so much and I was terrified. He said yes but since it was my first time I wasn‚Äôt very good and he got annoyed and said I was bad at it and went back to doing what he was doing before and held me down and started choking me. He ending up finishing inside me. Without a condom. The day after I walked to the nearest pharmacy and met my best friend there so I could buy a plan B. When I went home I told my dad what happened and he got mad at me and said he hoped I learned my lesson by being alone with a boy and said I should‚Äôve screamed. Idk why I didn‚Äôt, I was just crying and repeating ‚Äústop‚Äù. So I guess I could‚Äôve done something. But today I‚Äôve been sick and I have been peeing blood and stuff so I think he gave me a disease. I don‚Äôt want to go to my dad again. I don‚Äôt speak to my mother (not since 2021). Honestly I don‚Äôt think life is worth living anymore and I don‚Äôt know if I will be here much longer. I‚Äôve never felt like this before. I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do. I have always loved life and wanted to live it to the fullest but ever since this I just haven‚Äôt felt the same and I‚Äôm scared. Im also scared if the plan B doesn‚Äôt work because I googled it and there‚Äôs a chance it doesn‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt want to have a disease or be pregnant. And I don‚Äôt know how to move on. I don‚Äôt think I will ever get over this. ",

And if that fails, teach out to girlfriends and try to spend as much time as possible with them and process. Perhaps you could find more compassion in friend‚Äôs mothers, women standing for each other. Right now it feels like the world is crumbling upon you, but this is not the whole world, just a chapter.\nSo sorry this happened to you. i experienced something similar when I was 16. I wanted to wash myself for eternity until I scrub him off. It passed, and I survived.
