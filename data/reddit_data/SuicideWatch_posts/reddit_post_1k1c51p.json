That's why I can't judge those resolved to take this step.\n\n¬†Often, people don't truly want to die; they just want their suffering to end. Not all problems are temporary. An incurable illness causing constant pain is a prime example. In such cases, I believe we must respect the person's choice and thats it.\n\n¬†On the other hand, issues like school bullying or other forms of abuse (which are profoundly serious and may leave permanent scars) are ultimately transient. It's particularly heartbreaking when victims choose suicide - it feels like 'punishment for having suffered', you know?\n\n¬†That's why supporting those in such profound pain is more crucial than debating the morality of their choice.

My opinion is that you dont care about those, people who sre in pain are often VERY abusive towards other people. Especially those that try to help them as they are finally heard and feel the sense of control and unintentionally vent on you.
