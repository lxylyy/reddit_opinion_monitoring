  "selftext": "I 16m was groomed and raped from the ages of 8-14. I‚Äôve been very poor for my whole life, and my mother died at childbirth. My father blames me for her death. When I met a woman at the park who was nice to me it was the first time I ever felt welcomed. She would become what I thought was something of a mother to me and she would buy me various things. She got me hooked on drugs. When my dad was drunk I would go over to her house and spend the night. When I was 10 years old she got naked for me to see and explore her. After a couple of months of just touching her she told me to get naked and would have sex with me, she told me that if anyone found out then we couldn‚Äôt be friends anymore and that I would go back to being a kid who got no attention and was abused at home. For the 4 years that we had been sexual she would stick thing up my butt and in my urethra. When I was 14 I had finally woken up to what was happening but everyone I told either dismissed it or congratulated me. I feel violated and disgusting. Nobody I talk to seems to care and I‚Äôm violently afraid of women. I‚Äôm sitting in the woods with a bottle of pills right now and I‚Äôm ready to kill my self. I‚Äôm just waiting for a reason not to. Though I doubt anyone would care like always",

Foster homes, the streets, She got into drugs, had a lot of men issues, drinking. She had it bad. At like 25ish she totally turned her life around. She decided not to allow the past to control her future. She know is married, has 3 kids, her own home, and has become the person she has always wanted to be. The lesson in this story is, what your going through right now isn‚Äôt forever, things change, people change, you can change. If she had taken her life when she was younger, which she has several suicide attempts, she would of missed out on everything she has now. She is genuinely a happy, grateful person. If you ask her how she got to where she is, she would tell you she allowed her child hood and past to motivate her and create a life she never expected. Don‚Äôt do it, who knows what you will miss out on in your future. ‚ô•Ô∏è \n\nI‚Äôm also so sorry you went through what you did. Some humans are fuckin sick and deserve to die, like my father.
