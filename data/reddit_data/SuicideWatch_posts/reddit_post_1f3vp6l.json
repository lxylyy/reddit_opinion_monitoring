  "title": "My wife died at 27, had been together our whole adult lives",
  "selftext": "She died 5 days ago after being hospitalised for 2 weeks.\n\nWe had been together since high school. Married on 7th July 2023.  She was my best friend, my home and core to all my dreams. \n\nWe shared all our values and life goals, we wanted a family and children. We wanted to see the world and build careers that would let us make a difference. \n\nShe wanted to help victims of violent crimes, she had endless empathy for people and the courage to try to empower those who had suffered from the most horrific crimes.\n\nShe followed me from our home in Helsinki to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where I got a job soon after our wedding. We loved our lives there. She was blossoming, made the sweetest friends, and was working the perfect job that allowed her to work remotely while I worked my office job.\n\n9th August 2024 she falls ill, I figure it's just a flu as I had one too and she tends to always get hit by the flu harder than me. For a full 24 hours I just take care of her at home, thinking rest is all she needs. The next day she is delirious, I still think this might just be a combo of the flu and the aural migraines she would often get. We get to the hospital around midday. It's malaria. I still think: \"they know exactly how to treat malaria here, she'll be just fine\"\n\n2 weeks of fighting, complication after complication. On the 24th of August 2024, at 9AM, the doctors tell us her brain herniated, she was brain dead. The next 16 hours we watched her body give up. We were sobbing, sleeping and staring into the void over what was basically already a corpse being kept \"alive\" by tubes and medication. Tanzanian law would not allow her to be unplugged at the moment of brain death. 25th August 3AM, she is pronounced dead.\n\nI'm back in Finland now at my parents' house. I have barely left my childhood bedroom. I dont have a home anymore. I lost my best friend, my first and only love, my future.\n\nI'm in agony, the memories of our life together and her tubed corpse swirling in my head. I dont know how to live without her, I dont know how to function. I feel so alone, despite family and friends trying to be there for me.\n\nI would not want to live, but I cant hurt my family more than they are already hurting. They loved her like a daughter.\n\nI just want my home back, I want to be loved like she loved me.\n\n",
