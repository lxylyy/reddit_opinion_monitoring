Being told that I‚Äôm wrong and actually there is some mythical person in the world who gives a shit about me is like telling me that Santa Claus loves me. It‚Äôs bullshit. I have no friends and my family doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about me. Nobody in the rest of the world cares. Everyone just cares about themselves and there is no such thing as empathy or basic human kindness or whatever bullshit. It doesn‚Äôt exist. \n\nIt‚Äôs embarrassing when I have to make some bullshit ‚Äúsuicide plan‚Äù so I can reassure some doctors who don‚Äôt actually give a shit that I won‚Äôt kill myself, and they ask me to list people who I can talk to when I‚Äôm in a crisis and I cannot come up with a single fucking name. And they‚Äôre always like ‚Äúohhh that‚Äôs so sad, really, you don‚Äôt have anyone? You can‚Äôt think of anyone?‚Äù Nope. It‚Äôs like they can‚Äôt fucking fathom that someone doesn‚Äôt have any support system. That never happens in magical happy doctor land. And then the ‚Äúsuicide plan‚Äù that I‚Äôm forced to make is never mentioned again, and I just go on with my merry life all by myself as usual. It‚Äôs such Bull Shit with a capital fucking B. No one actually gives a fuck.\n\nIt‚Äôs great how I live every day wanting to kill myself and if I show any sign of not being happy I either get screamed at and berated or I get fake sympathy from people who forget about me the second after I stop talking to them. Nobody actually cares. I could kill myself and I doubt anyone would even notice for a while. Everyone will just go on with their merry little life and I‚Äôll be forgotten. I can‚Äôt wait for that to happen, because existing in this bullshit life just sucks. Every day sucks and it gets worse every day. What is the fucking point \n",
