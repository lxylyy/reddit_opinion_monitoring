      "body": "God I wish I could swing on your parents. The fuckers who did this to you, also, but as an adult it's heavily frowned upon to be challenging teenagers to a throwing of hands. I'm gonna clip over most of the emotional stuff I could get into here, not because I am treating this callously or would like to give that impression, but just because there's a f**k ton of info I wish someone had given me after my first experience getting SAd as a teen that could actually help.\n\n° Play Tetris. Playing Tetris, in combination with therapy, showed significant improvements on PTSD scores after a 6 week trial, compared to the control group (therapy alone). They're still trying to nail down the specifics, but the process of rotating those blocks in your mind helps tap into and reorganize/write over the damaged and incorrectly filed memories that are haunting you. It's most effective the night after, but it's still substantially effective *if you play it every night* for a few weeks.\n\n\n° Find something physical, that you enjoy. You need somewhere for that fear and anger to go. Fear functions off adrenaline, and your body and brain are currently in a permanent state of fight/flight/freeze, with all the endorphins and adrenaline to go along with that. So, if you give that fear a tangible source (I'm not afraid of everyone on earth, I'm nervous because I'm rock climbing, or playing soccer, or my first boxing lesson is harder than I thought it would be), and a discrete beginning, middle, and end, you can *trick your central nervous system into correctly wiring the response*, again writing over that rut in your brain that says \"hyper vigilance 24/7\". \n\n\n° Find something physical you enjoy, part 2. Our society doesn't talk about healthy and productive expressions of anger. You have some excellent reasons to be angry. Your subconscious doesn't speak English, and thus has no awareness that it's \"not supposed to\" feel rage at such a violation. So, if you can't find anywhere to externalize that anger, it just bounces around making you sick. But, there's plenty of cool, productive, positive things you can do with that \"negative\" feeling. Boxing, self defense training (has the added benefit of healing the emotional part of you that felt defenseless and vulnerable from the original SA as well), landscaping and gardening, working with livestock or dogs (obviously don't get angry at the animals, but these are both very physical tasks that will eat frustration and return a very happy dog, horse, herd of goats, etc). \n\n\n° Find something expressive you enjoy. Writing, art, music, poetry, stand up comedy even, anything that takes what is presently a tangled up mess of emotions, hurt, and neurotransmitters and transmutes them into something outside of yourself. You want to get the emotions into something external, and then the next step is to see if sharing your art also feels cathartic. If it does, good news! The **single strongest predictor of whether or not you will develop PTSD after an isolated event is whether you feel you have a sense of community to call upon**. Taking your pain, turning it into art, and then sharing that art to find more people who get it, is a path forward that could carry you well into adulthood. It certainly has for me.",

If you could have, YOU WOULD HAVE!\n\nThe reason you couldn’t avoid it, is because you didn’t have the skills to. You might think you had the skills, but you didn’t, that’s why you didn’t avoid it.\n\nIt actually requires a huge amount of skill and knowledge to avoid situations like this, that majority of all adults do not have, so ofcorse a 10year old would not have the skills and knowledge to avoid this.\n\nYou said it started with touching and hand stuff, and you still went back. You went back because you didn’t have the knowledge or skills to understand that you disliked what happened, or that something could happen again, or that something worse could happen. Looking back with hindsight it’s easy to see that something worse was going to happen, and you now realise you didn’t like what happened with the touching and hand stuff, and wish you didn’t go back, but at the time, your mind hadn’t processed that, it hadn’t made sense of it, it hadn’t calculated that you didn’t like what happened, and that you shouldn’t go back.\n\nJust because you went back doesn’t mean it’s ok for them to sexually assault you. It wasn’t ok for them to do it the first time with the touching and the hand stuff. And if it was actually a case of you consensually agreeing to do the touching and hand stuff the first times, that still doesn’t mean it’s ok for them to sexually assault you ever!\n\nIt doesn’t matter what you did or said in the lead up to any sexual assault, that does not give anyone permission to sexually assault you.\n\nYou could have sex with someone consensually 100 times, meaning you agreed to and where happy to have sex with them these previous 100 times, it does not give them permission to now sexually assault you.\n\nYou could also get sexually assaulted 100 times and keep going back to them, it does not give them permission to now sexually assault you. \n\nAlso, you were 10! Any sexual contact with anyone under the age of consent in that country (UK it’s 16 years old) is illegal! It does not matter if the child agrees to it or not! You’re brain has not fully developed yet, not even close, you are not able to make decisions of such magnitude, that’s why it’s illegal.\n\nThe fact you’re now 14 and know as much as you’ve expressed in your post is way above your age level. \n\nOf course you kept going back to them, you were 10 years old. The fact you were 10 years old is the reason you did it, it’s completely understandable the fact you went back to them each time, even after they had already done stuff to you, or even if you agreed to do it (I don’t know if you did agree to it or not because you didn’t mention, but it also doesn’t matter, whether you agreed to or not, and went back to them, it’s because of everything I’ve mentioned above, and also whether you agreed to it or not, doesn’t mean anyone can ever do anything sexual with you without your permission. They also can’t just because of your age).\n\nThere are endless reasons why this is 100% not your fault AT ALL! It’s not even possible to be your fault.\n\nAlso, this IS your parents fault. They’re obviously going to say it’s not their fault because they’re irresponsible immature inappropriate parents, but the fact is you did not ask to be born, and you needed them to protect nurture and guide you and they have not done that. You should be angry at them, they have COMPLETELY let you down! FACT!\n\nYou’re parents did not teach you the things they had a responsibility to teach you. That’s why you were not able to avoid this situation. That’s why you kept going back to them every day despite previous stuff having already having happened. \n\nIt IS your parents fault. And if you ever have your own kids and something happens to them, it will be your fault.",
