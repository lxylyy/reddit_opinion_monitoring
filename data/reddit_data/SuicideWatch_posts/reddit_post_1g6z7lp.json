  "selftext": "Last year she first told me she didn't want to be alive anymore. She was 7. I got her in with a great therapist who she still sees.\n\nA month ago she did that phrase again. We made a safety plan at therapy. Two days later she threatened to bring a gun to school so I took her to the hospital for an evaluation. Cue us being held for 8 hours in the most dehumanizing experience only to be told not only did they have nowhere for her to go due to her age, but that her threats weren't credible anyways and we got sent home.\n\nTonight she got upset over something minor and completely went over the edge. Said she doesn't understand why she feels this way, why she has these thoughts. She wanted to kill herself although she didn't make specific threats. She then asked her sister to kill her. \n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I'm doing everything right... She's in therapy, she doesn't have a history of experiencing abuse or trauma, we went to the hospital and it was NOT helpful .. so what's next?",

They greatly increase the chance of suicidal thought. Bipolar and adhd in particular can best be managed by medication, not just therapy. If I didn‚Äôt have my bipolar medication I may have died by now. \n\nYou may wonder if there are other factors like people are saying. my thought is that getting bullied may explain it a little, but considering there are no signs of childhood trauma she should reasonably be able to regulate better from having a healthy family. That‚Äôs why I worry that it‚Äôs a deeper medical issue. \n\nI also had a neighbor whose kid (around your kids age) got diagnosed with PANDAS, a condition rarely induced by strep throat. It can cause these sorts of neurological changes. So physical diseases can also cause this sort of thing.\n\nMy advice is look into the cause. Medication may be your savior. Get a mental health evaluation for her.\n\nEdit: there are disorders that represent childhood bipolar or predict bipolar behaviors. No, she doesn‚Äôt need a full bipolar diagnosis. She can still be helped by medication depending on which issue she might be facing. Arguing about technicalities is annoying and unhelpful.\n\nAlso note that I‚Äôm not attempting to diagnose her I‚Äôm recommending getting more intense help. There are many other potential issues that cause suicidal thoughts. Schizophrenia is another one.",

      "body": "I‚Äôm so sorry you and your daughter are going through this, OP. I also started feeling suicidal when I was 8, I‚Äôm now 35. Please understand the following is from my own experience, and not intended as judgement toward you or anyone else:\n\n1: You say she hasn‚Äôt experienced any abuse or trauma. But, how can you be certain? We all have different protective factors and thresholds for trauma - what is traumatic to one person, may not be to the next. It‚Äôs also possible that there are traumatic or abusive events that you don‚Äôt know about. There could be events that deeply affected her that she doesn‚Äôt consciously understand as traumatic, or abusive. So she doesn‚Äôt think to bring them up.\n\n2: Environment can be a major contributor to things like this. Does she have a good relationship with her parents? Does she feel safe in her home? Does she feel heard? For myself, two different social workers -technically- saw nothing wrong with my home, as a kid. But I never felt safe in my home, and my father was verbally (and sometimes physically) abusive. I was an undiagnosed autistic child that was deeply affected by the chaos of my family, even when my siblings were (mostly) ok. And so, it was always seen as something wrong with ME. But once I escaped my parents house, I blossomed. I‚Äôm not saying this to try and say you‚Äôre a ‚Äúbad parent‚Äù, but maybe your daughter is similarly sensitive, and maybe even autistic, too? Environmental overwhelm can be absolutely devastating for us, especially when we‚Äôre so young and so new to experiencing all these feelings. Try to step back and take a hard look at what your dynamic might look like to your daughter - and ask her, too. Ask her if she feels safe at home, ask her what she needs to feel safe, if not. Make sure her bedroom is her sanctuary - never walk in unannounced, decorate it to her liking (to the best of your ability/means/etc). \n\n3: Bullying at school was a major reason I wanted to end my life at such a young age. It made it so I didn‚Äôt feel safe or accepted anywhere - home was chaotic, kids at school were cruel. I had nowhere to go to just exist as me, and not be under stress. I‚Äôm glad your daughter has a great therapist to confide in! But if she‚Äôs not already involved in after school activities, it could be worth looking into some for her. Art groups and classes are where I found my peace, as a kid. \n\nIn summary: the reason I felt suicidal so young is because of an overwhelming feeling of being unsafe, unwanted, and like I was the problem. I had nowhere I could go to find peace, away from the bullies and my screaming father and my helicopter mother. I had severe anxiety issues that took most of my life to work through, that still pop up from time to time. \n\nAgain, I know this comment is making a lot of assumptions‚Ä¶ but if your daughter is anything like me, I really hope this can help you, help her. I know you love her and will do whatever you can to make her better. Thank you for reaching out. I really hope things get better for the poor kid.",

Nothing I say next is a reflection on you as a parent, I‚Äôd say this to any parent and I have done! Can I ask, are YOU in therapy? What is the situation with the rest of your immediate family and their mental health? You just need to understand that you have a very narrow window to get on top of this or it becomes cemented in her mind, and not much longer after that it starts to physiologically take hold. Her alone having therapy is not the beginning and end of the solution. I know how huge an ask this is, but I urge you all (all family members) to deeply evaluate and treat the entire family unit. There may be an external influence of her suicidality (friends, bullies, learning difficulties etc) but kids don‚Äôt arrive at that solution first. By age 7 she has established that death is the solution to her suffering, which means generally she has thought and tried other solutions but hasn‚Äôt been successful. And I want to stress to you that just because you don‚Äôt think she has experienced abuse or trauma, doesn‚Äôt mean she hasn‚Äôt. Suffering is relative. Trauma is formed by being left in pain. Physical, emotional‚Ä¶.. it doesn‚Äôt matter what the pain is, if you are left in it and not moving through it, it forms trauma. And two people can have the exact same experience and one can form a trauma from it and one won‚Äôt, so please, do not be dismissive about her pain and suffering, or the cause of it. Again, I‚Äôm not saying this is the case for your daughter, I‚Äôm giving you context on your perception because you as her mother are too close to the situation that you aren‚Äôt able to see the full picture. So her mindset can come from many sources, but the key to getting her through this and get her back on track to becoming a healthy human with strong coping mechanisms and the ability to overcome adversity‚Ä¶.comes back to ensuring she has a safe and supportive space at home. You might think she does, but what you consider safe and supportive might differ to her, as it does between most humans. These are things you can establish and develop in family therapy. In terms of her personal therapy, what has her therapist said in terms of diagnosis or evaluation? Do they specialise in anything in particular (like neurodivergence? Behavioural issues?). As a woman, I strongly recommend seeing a therapist who specialises in neurodivergent girls for at least an evaluation. She may not be, and I could be projecting, but it does hit home for me and you will NOT get that help at a hospital or through any kind of general medical system.",

Most doctors don't like giving medication to young children, but in some cases, it's necessary. We have such strong mental health concerns in our family that even the 5yo has to have medication to manage moods and other issues that otherwise can't be handled due to age and not being fully mentally developed enough to understand and try to control/modify those behaviors and impulses.\n\nAnd as someone else commented, it sucks to violate privacy, but keep strict tabs on what your child is exposed to. Anything online, if they have creative hobbies (writing/drawing), check to see what they're expressing or looking up or anything else to gain any insight. It's such a rough time to try to manage and can put extreme strain on the parent/child relationship, but when it's the safety of your child and those around them, some sacrifices have to be made until the situation can be brought under control.\n\nI am so sorry you're having to go through this.

The strained relationship with her dad might be the main reason, besides bullying, negative media or lack of positive outlets for self-expression.\n\nI've had suicidal ideation since I was 6. At this age my thoughts weren't exactly formulated as \"I want to kill myself, I want to commit the physical act of unaliving myself\", more like \"I wish I wasn't alive, I wish I wasn't ever born, I wish I could just disappear\". I used to be a believer back then, so I would pray God to take me back to him, cause I thought that was the best thing, the right thing to do. I wasn't actively suicidal, but I was aware that I might do it at some point and I believed I wouldn't reach the age of 12 years old, because I would have surely killed myself by then (I'm 27 now).\n\nI remember clearly the reasons behind that state of mind. My mother had always told me she should have aborted me. I have always known that I wasn't meant to be born, that I was an accident, that my mother didn't plan me. My mother had good moments with me, there are many things to be grateful about her, don't get me wrong. It's just that every time she would get upset about something, she would go on rambling how my birth ruined her life, completely put her out of her path to achieve her dreams, how different her life would have been if she didn't give birth to me. There were also physical abuse besides the emotional one. I remember being dragged on the floor by my hair at the age of 5. So lots of mommy issues trauma.\n\nI don't have nearly as much daddy issues. I spent my childhood divided between living in my father's country with my parents and living in my mother's country with my grandparents (who were good to me). I never really got attached to my father to begin with. He didn't abuse me or neglect me, but he didn't either defend me much from my mother. I also knew he used to mistreat my mother and he did sorta abandon us twice.\n\nMaybe your daughter feels responsible for her father's actions, maybe she believes the world, your family would be better off without her. Maybe she feels undeserving to be alive. Maybe she's so much in pain she believes death would put an end to it. I can't tell what's the issue precisely, but for a little kid, their parents and family are their whole world. The relationship with their closest ones affects them deeply, more than anything else. I wouldn't overlook those daddy issues, I would try to better understand how she feels regarding this matter. Wishing you the best.",
