  "selftext": "I've been living in a nightmare for 4 months and I just want it to end so badly.  4 months ago my life was destroyed by what I thought would be a simple urologist check up.  It was definitely not that.  He \"examined\" my penis extremely roughly and stretched it very hard and crushed it.  Ever since my penis has been completely numb with total erectile dysfunction.  I suffer every moment of the day feeling a numb pressure uncomfortableness in my penis that makes it impossible to sleep and relax.  It drives me so crazy I sometimes I sometimes just want to cut it off for relief which is something I would never want.  I'm only 33 years old and I will never be able to feel or use my penis again.  The doctor damaged my bulbocavernosous muscle/nerve in my penis which is responsible for erections and ejaculations.  This muscle is extremely numb and lifeless now like the rest of my penis.\n\nNobody cares or believes me when I tell them what happened.  Doctors or lawyers.  I've been to several doctors and they don't know what to do.  They just gaslight me and say it might be psychological when it definitely is not.  I literally can't feel my penis at all anymore.  Not hot, cold, touch, pain, pressure, nothing.  It's completely numb.  My scrotum and penis are very cold to the touch 24/7.  I stay on high dose Cialis to see if it helps and it does nothing at all.  My penis stays numb and jelly like always.\n\nI've reported the uro to the hospital and medical board snd nothing happened.  People tell me things like I need to be strong and get over it.  Or your penis isn't everything.  It's so easy for someone else to say that.  They don't know how miserable it is.  I have no desire getting gaslit by more doctors, lawyers, or anyone else at this point.",

I‚Äôve had two surgeries, multiple joint dislocations, muscle injuries, head injuries, and been sexually assaulted myself. My nerves didn‚Äôt come back all the way normal, but enough to the point where I have feeling again. If you‚Äôve been trying to test whether your penis is numb or not, you may have been not letting the muscle rest. Let the muscle rest, and to prevent swelling, I‚Äôd recommend ice packing it 20 minutes on 20 minutes off if you can. Feeling might come back. \n\nYou went through something horrific. It‚Äôs common for sexual assault survivors to need support. I‚Äôd highly recommend working with a therapist trained in counseling male sexual assault survivors. \n  \nhttps://www.inclusivetherapists.com is a search engine that can help you find one that takes your insurance.

I‚Äôm going to try and condense this as much as possible while still being understandable. I used to be a very successful self employed dog groomer. In 2017 I was getting more and more pain in my right hip, and nothing (physical therapy, massages, acupuncture, chiropractic adjustments- I tried everything) was helping.\n\nSo I was referred to a highly respected surgeon in my area. He did some different tests and imaging, and said there was a labral tear that was the problem. He could fix it with endoscopic surgery (I think- this was in 2018 by this point) and I‚Äôd have 4 or 5 one inch incisions, and should be good to go after 6-8 weeks. \n\nWoke up from surgery with the feeling that something was very, very wrong. It was. I had 1 one inch incision, and then another that was approximately 5-6 inches down the front of my thigh. I was told that when they got in there the labrum wasn‚Äôt actually torn, so to get ‚Äúbetter visibility‚Äù he pretty much butterflied my thigh like a chicken leg. He said the pain was caused from a ‚Äúhip impingement‚Äù so he shaved down the head of my femur, popped it back into place, and all would be well in 8-10 weeks. \n\nNope. Leg constantly gave out on me, causing me to fall (and break teeth). Physical therapy wasn‚Äôt helping, and I was being accused of not doing my home exercises because otherwise I would be getting better. Finally my GP referred me to another surgeon to take a look at everything- he wasn‚Äôt local but again, great reviews and all the info I could find on him was positive.\n\nHe was extremely careful in the way he worded his diagnosis. (OP, if you‚Äôre reading this, this is an important part to look out for.) He ‚Äúunderstood my frustration and how things didn‚Äôt go according to plan, but sometimes imaging just doesn‚Äôt show the whole picture.‚Äù He was very careful to NOT say that the previous surgeon made a mistake or did anything wrong; it was unfortunate but there is always a risk in surgery that something could go wrong. A good surgeon can minimize that risk, but it‚Äôs still there. \n\nSo he came up with a plan to ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything (my word, not his, because that would imply the first surgeon screwed up). I was pretty nervous about a second surgery, but I couldn‚Äôt even walk around my house safely without my leg just suddenly giving out, so once more into the breach‚Ä¶\n\nHaven‚Äôt been without crutches, a walker or wheelchair since. Lost my business, am on full disability, and even though I had a very healthy ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù (which all self employed people should have at least double the recommended amount) I am now buried in a mountain of debt. No other doctors will even look at my case. And I spoke to MANY attorneys who specialize in medical malpractice cases- after reading all the paperwork from the surgeons, hospital staff, physical therapists, etc they said not one of those people even wrote a note that would hold up in court about anyone making a mistake. And because of how many medical professionals have looked at my files, there‚Äôs no way a semi competent defense attorney couldn‚Äôt convince a judge or jury that it was just a very unfortunate outcome but not the fault of anyone involved.\n\nAnd sadly this WAS the short version. I really hope OP has better luck. But based on my experience? The doctors cover each other and so do the support staff. They don‚Äôt really need the malpractice insurance, but I‚Äôm glad someone‚Äôs making money off of them since they can ruin people‚Äôs lives and then just shrug and move on to the next patient/paycheck.",
