Absolute waste of taxpayer funds sending the swat team to my parent‚Äôs over a young disabled guy with drugs. \nI‚Äôm charged with 19 drug charges in NJ one being 10-20 years minimum sentence. \nMy public defender is talking about potential of drug court. If that doesn‚Äôt happen and I go to prison I really believe I would kill myself. It‚Äôs concerning , my thoughts since being put in jail. My one cell mate got in a fight and I was locked down during the Holidays by myself. Started hearing voices in the room and became insane. If the plea deal isn‚Äôt right and it goes to trial Im most likely pulling the plug .  This justice system isn‚Äôt fair and most likely going to fuck me. Incarceration isn‚Äôt for someone with my disability and charges ",
