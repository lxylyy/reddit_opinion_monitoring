Not depression, not clinical, not persistent, because again I dont feel the pain. You might claim its numbed. But I dont believe that because when this first started, I wasnt even feeling any pain. I KNOW that Ive opened up my mind to these realities. Not a mindset nor a feeling thats fleeting.\n\nAnd to say that I should give life a chance? Is no. I refuse life because I as myself who controls my own body, should have a right just like I have a right to live, as to die as well. Even if its self inflicted.\n\nI dont particularly believe Im doing this to myself, because I dont have any addictions or anything. I just... refuse change. Because all together, I simply refuse life. And to say 'well your refusing that change to make you happy' is baseless to me because again, I hate change, it disgusts me, because as a misanthrope, thats how I tend to see things.\n\nto say 'you only live once' is baseless once again to me. Because I dont care. If I can escape earth. Fuck yeah. Im in. Just not in a painful way. Argon usage. Lol.\n\nAlso maybe YOU wouldnt  give up so easily. Hey how about you go ENJOY your life since you have things that make you happy? Instead of talking to a rational 'suicidist' I guess you can call it.\n\nStop trying to instill fear into somebody whos made their mind up with clarity (Not OP) by saying you will cease to exist after death, which is true, but again, when you die, you wont be aware that your dead, and wont know your dead, your just... dead.\n\nMy life, my body, my choice.",
