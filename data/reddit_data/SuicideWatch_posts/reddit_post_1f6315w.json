  "selftext": "My husband of 20 years wants a girlfriend and I told him he can and it‚Äôs alright. I‚Äôve been in bed since and I really just want to die. I loved him with everything I had and now I feel like such an idiot. I shared my entire life with him. I‚Äôd feel like even more of an idiot if anyone found out I killed myself over a boy but I‚Äôm horribly lonely and feel completely abandoned. I wouldn‚Äôt be around to feel embarrassed \n\nEdit: to answer some questions, he has a girlfriend in mind. He met her on work trips. She lives across on opposite coast from us (USA) she asked him out according to him. I am completely financially dependent and have no savings, only debt, a car loan, student loans, credit card bills. I think my plan is to get a job and get to a place where I could leave. Reassess from there. I‚Äôd feel more confident if I didn‚Äôt need him so much. He can have his fucking side relationship but I‚Äôm my new hobby is going to be myself. I know it‚Äôs not as healthy as ending things immediately but I can‚Äôt afford it. Thank you everyone, your kind words mean so much to me ",

      "body": "First, I'm very sorry you have experienced this shock to the system and your life. I know it's devastating. I know you'll wonder how you'll go on. It is a big uphill climb out of this despair, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. \n\nSecond, make NO rash decisions. Be smart and be calm. Calmness will be your guiding hand through this. Anger, arguments, shouting, etc will be your demons.  Do NOT fall victim to the moment. It'll be very easy to lose your cool when there's confrontation but you MUST be the level-headed one. \n\nThird, do not beg or plead with him. That will NOT work. It'll only render you powerless. A calm, cool, confident demeanor will give you the upper hand. It might in fact drive him to anger and rash decisions on HIS part knowing you're stronger than he ever thought. \n\nFourth, go ahead and protect ALL your assets. Move all your money and investments into your own name, with secure passwords. If there are any joint credit cards, cancel them immediately or if possible, remove him from the account. Do this! Do it regardless of the long-term outcome. Anything else that is joint accounts, do whatever you can to get them in your name. \n\nFifth, under no circumstance do you move out. I repeat, do NOT move out. He is the one that needs to do that. if he's reasonable (which clearly he's not), then he'll be the one who needs to leave. \n\nSixth, if there are children, do NOT get them in the middle of this. No matter who's at fault, your children deserve to love their mom and dad regardless of the situation between you and your wayward husband. In time, they can discern the truth for themselves. Kids are wise. \n\nSeventh, do not rush to date. Don't do anything out of retribution. You'll only end up disrespecting yourself for it. You'll know in due time, which may be a long time from now, when you're ready to step back out there. Now is not the time. \n\nNow, about your husband: He's in a middle-aged fog. He's likely already caught the eye of someone, I assure you. Be it at work, the gym, online, or somewhere, he's already got his eyes set on someone or they may be chasing him. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a dating profile. This \"need\" of his didn't just come out of the blue. \n\nI'm of the belief that the more you fight and chase and plead and cry, it'll only push him away further. I'm more of the mindset to just 100% take care of yourself and if you have kids, take care of them. Act as if it's already a done deal. Move forward. Be active with your life. Securing all your possessions and finances should keep you busy enough for awhile, but do other things to keep you running. Gym, walks, church, work, art, weekend trips or day trips, etc. \n\nFinally, I'll say this: I know it sounds like I'm suggesting you're already on the path to divorce. I'm not though. What I'm more stressing right now is that you CANNOT be caught blindsided (again) by further actions from your husband. If he does get involved with someone else, there is no telling what his brainwashed mind could get up to. He could try to cut you out of any number of things in your life - finances, house, cars, possessions, kids, etc. So best to just set everything in motion as if it is headed for the worst outcome. \n\nYou have been dealt an awful blow. It very much is like a death. You are allowed to grieve. Even if he comes to his senses, a part of the innocence of your life has died. It's a sad realization. I'm so sorry for that. But you can and will be resilient. You can persevere. Just hang in there and please reach out, like you've done, if you feel you're desperate. \n\nWishing you strength!",

In all honesty, he probably is too scared to leave and it's why he's forcing you into this situation. It's only because it's still comfortable for him. But the real question is, is it comfortable for you? It sounds like it's not.

Not all men are like this, same as not all women are the negative features found in many of them. You will brick by brick take a break and find you built alot while in autopilot just going through the motions but do not settle for that extortion, take half his stuff, give him half your debt, realize you came out crisp and DO NOT TAKE IT BACK WHEN IT REALIZED ITS LITTLE FANTASY OF SELFISH DISREGARD DIDNT PAN OUT! For all he knows it's just a homewrecker who tests men into ruining their foundations for sport beaten having no more challenge to compete for, or she asked it out (if she even actually did and not just mixed signals or half ego fantasy) not knowing he was 2 decades married etc. No matter what, especially cross continent immoral relationships will not actually last, he probably thinks he's some catch because a female he is attracted to actually showed him the least bit of attention lol. I van guarantee you thst you will have no problem finding another partner, or many, maybe don't invest atleast too soon and go around sharing the love and that 50% marital property will be a nice little leg up to start your next phase of life which will absolutely be so exciting and stellar, and don't look back at all!!!! If you simply put yourself in the public arena, I promise you will quickly fins social networks that can't wait to have you join them and even support networks for people in similar despair. You'll get an easy peezy little job to start with and even consider brainstorming business ideas you would actually be happy to go to and grow day by day, find like minded others maybe interested and I can promise you that the best and most creative and innovative ideas are captured and comprehended when the mind in a chaos state like yours is now. Don't show that coward a single tear, agree to divorce and stsrt just going out as much as you can and not everything requires money, my happiest and wildest eras of my life were when I was dead broke and had to actually get creative to occupy my time and id meet people and I do art also so my most creative phases were when I had no money for resources and had to be conservative and crafty. You can start reselling on marketplace and other sites just to get that palm itchy and hunger and drive, and like I said brick by brick is how everything is built, starting at 1st step requires a trustworthy autopilot so just repeat the motions in a step by step plan and I promise you your life is about to get truly exciting and you've actually been hoarded away from the world by a selfish child that doesn't appreciate its life, and I don't know your physical factors but no matter what they are, start a healthy exercise and diet regimen, drink lots of water and pick your best face to go out everyday and be kind and polite, compliment strangers with genuine compliments, smile at people and laugh often. Your hopefully ex husband will be in for a very regrettable time I can promise and that's all there is to it. It might stsrt saying stuff like \"why didn't you dress, exercise/diet and present yourself for me until you weren't mine anymore?\" That's all just tactics to make you feel as though it was your fault and don't fall for them. I hope you the very best and I'm so serious, like whatever time it is there now, whatever the very next morning is, I beg you to tune in and get focused and ready because everything WILL BE INCREDIBLE IF YOU LET IT BE!!!! Even if making it jealous is your initial fuel, that's OK just sooner than later let yourself and your life be your motivation and purpose. I wish I could know you and see how much everything I am promising you will actually happen but women ALWAYS HAVE THE UPPERHAND AND OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING PARTNERS! ALWAYS! That's why I appreciate them and am never cruel or betray them even if it doesn't pan out or we don't get too serious I always appreciate the love they were generous with and they can really shatter self esteem so there's that factor too lol. I've been in a relationship as long as 12 years and been in very short ones or only 5 years on and off, and everything in between was being a bit of a slooot admittedly but never mean or deceived them, when that happened I always made it clear I am not capable of being in a committed relationship without dropping the ball bad so while I'll happily only be with you while we are, I can't rightfully commit to that because I am a mess and a loser trying to get to a better status and a relationship would inhibit that, but I still need love lol. I hope you play the field and share your love responsibly until love finds you, and don't punish other people for what it did to you, they aren't it and don't deserve that while still protecting yourself.

He's testing his new relationship out to make sure it will work before committing to leaving you, and will inevitably find some minor thing you did and blame that as the catalyst for why he ended up leaving.  That way he can still feel like the good guy who did nothing wrong.  After all, this type of relationship is something you both agreed upon.   I'm not blaming you, I'm just saying this is a story that has been retold thousands of times, as people engage more and more in \"ethical non-monogammy.\"\n\n  One route you could go, you need to tell him you love him.  You've devoted 20 years of your life to this man, and it is wrong for him to use and discard the years you've given him.  You want to make the marriage work, and you're willing to do what you have to do in order to save it.  Get a job.  Go out and get hobbies.  Be someone he wants to chase again.  Lots of wives revert to sweat pants and messy buns.  Don't be like that.  Buy a dress that makes you feel beautiful and wear it.  He has caught you and knows that you're so reliant upon him, you'll always be available for him.\n  \n  I advise asking him what kind of woman flirts with, and indulges in a relationship with a married man?  Why wouldn't she do the exact same thing with someone else?   \n Another route to consider: You're not dealing with your husband.  You're dealing with your husband's penis.  You could also ask if he will sign a postnup that entitles you to the house and a percentage of his income for a number of years, and you'll leave without a fuss.  If he refuses, you could notify his HR dept that he is in a relationship with another coworker.  \n\n  I am so sorry you're going through this.  It is utterly cruel and wrong.  I have been through what you have, and their relationship didn't even last 4 months.  Once I was out of the way, there was no woman to compete with and she lost interest.

I won't pretend like he was always a manipulative jerk, I don't know, maybe he was an angel, but people change... You need to take care of yourself. I hope you're not really planning about dying.
