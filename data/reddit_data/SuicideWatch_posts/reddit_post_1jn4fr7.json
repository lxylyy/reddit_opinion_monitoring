  "selftext": "The first 2 weeks were manageable only because I know I had to make sure she was taken care of and cremated after her service, she was always so impatient and wanted things to be taken care of quickly so I felt it was right I handled everything as quick and as best as possible for her. \n\nNow that everything has been handled for her, this week has been so fucking hard for me and I can not stop thinking about taking my own life to be back with her. I miss her so fucking much, shes my soulmate and I love her so fucking much, I lost myself the day she left me. I dont want this to be my ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù, I dont want to keep going without her. I tried a grief counselor and it didnt help me, my friends and family have been very supportive but my mind only stays distracted for so long. We both didnt want to live till we were old but I still wanted us to live out our lives a little while longer. \n\nI want to kill myself so fucking bad to be back with her but I know I dont have the balls to do it and its eating me alive. Im so scared that I will fail (Ive attempted before and never succeeded, this was before I met her) and im so scared that I dont know what happens after. Will be back with her? Will it just be a dark abyss of nothing? I dont fucking know and its the hardest part. I just want to talk to her, hold her, kiss her, be with her. I know ill never be able to pull a trigger, Im just hoping that when I hop on my street bike I just happen to wreck at 180+ and instantly go because this pain is so fucking unbearable. \n",

      "body": "Great for you. Unfortunately, the realistic thing is that someone is hospitalized and transferred to an in network facility, meaning it‚Äôs run by a private mega company. Your experience is great, but extremely uncommon. \n\nThere are overwhelming majorities of past patients saying mental facilities are glorified prisons that strip you of basic freedoms in the name of treatment when they actually deprive you of your basic human rights, freedoms, and create extreme trauma from the unstable environment and frequent violent outbursts, and even patients attacking them for no reason.\n\nI have had consistently horrible experiences in the 5 places I‚Äôve been in (mind you they‚Äôre in different networks, and one was even non-profit) for this exact reason and it boiled down to the fact they took people who didn‚Äôt belong in those programs because it was profitable and filled up beds, and the staff abuses patients verbally, emotionally and even sometimes physically to be entertained. I literally got sexually assaulted at one of the places. And I got punched in the head that they not only punished me for despite the fact I did nothing and that person attacked me before for no reason, but initially refused to get me help for until my mom forced them to, to make sure I was okay. Well, I had a concussion and brain swelling. At another I was manhandled and purposefully provoked to force me to stay longer AND punish me. We weren‚Äôt fed decent food. We didn‚Äôt get to go outside when we wanted. We didn‚Äôt get to watch tv, listen to music, or talk to people on the phone without permission or a time limit of 5-10 minutes. We didn‚Äôt see our doctors or clinicians for more than 30 minutes every 1-2 weeks. We didn‚Äôt get to even do our laundry or take a nap if we were tired. How is that beneficial when you‚Äôre not being prepared to actually handle the real world that put you there in the first place?\n\nOne of the head staff at the second place I was forced to was charged for physically abusing a patient. This is horrifically common and to tell people to ‚Äújust research it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help whatsoever. The places I went were recommended and direct referrals from previous treatment. But it wasn‚Äôt what my mom and i were told it was. It was hell. I‚Äôm glad you had a good experience. But 99% of us didn‚Äôt. Those places exist to stop you from killing yourself, hurting yourself, hurting others, engaging in harmful behavior, etc. most of them keep you 7-10 days or 1-3 months. If treatment was a priority, you wouldn‚Äôt meet your clinician once every two weeks, or a prescriber every month. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what lala land you‚Äôre living in but just because you had a positive experience doesn‚Äôt change the fact the healthcare system in the US is a corporate nightmare with little to no interest for the person at hand who needs the care. More time means more money from the insurance companies, meaning more money from the person paying for the insurance itself. And I could say maybe it used to be, but it never was. It never has been. This entire concept was based on locking up, and essentially forcibly experimenting on mentally ill people. Autistic children were literally chained to radiators. It‚Äôs never been about helping people. It‚Äôs an abusive system that‚Äôs gotten better at masking it. Locking people away against their will doesn‚Äôt have positive benefits. It further damages their psyche. It teaches them to hide their actual emotions because they don‚Äôt want to be punished or end up back somewhere like that. It stunts development and prevents people from properly functioning in society. When addiction recovery sober living houses have more freedom than most mental health facilities, shouldn‚Äôt that ring some bells? People who literally are doing drugs per their initial choice and are a liability under the law have more freedom than someone who‚Äôs suffering against their will? The same negative impact is found with literal prisoners. Shouldn‚Äôt that say something? Please stop suggesting and normalizing impatient treatment just because you had a good experience, because it‚Äôs almost always a dystopian traumatic borderline prison nightmare wrapped in cold ventilation, pants and shoes with their laces cut out, and grippy socks meant to enlist fear, and dehumanize the people forced to be there against their will.",

I don‚Äôt have an attitude. and that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I just said the truth, whether you like it, or not, which you don‚Äôt... It IS the cold, hard, ugly truth. And the fact of the matter is, most of those places do not help long term. Because they are not simply not designed to. That‚Äôs why so many people who have gone to them are deathly afraid to ASK for help, because they were traumatized when they tried to. I‚Äôm not being gaslit by someone who wants to write off people‚Äôs trauma because they weren‚Äôt affected by that kind of experience. You‚Äôre inherently committing the behavior that continues the cycle of harmful invalidation and discrediting of peoples‚Äô struggles and emotions.\n\nAgain, like I said, your experience isn‚Äôt everyone else‚Äôs. Quite the opposite, actually. The majority say the complete opposite. Getting a therapist and psychiatrist, as well as outpatient partial programs is actually productive and beneficial. Locking someone away is dehumanizing and harmful to most people. Human beings are not meant to be locked away or isolated. You had a choice. Most people do not have that luxury.
