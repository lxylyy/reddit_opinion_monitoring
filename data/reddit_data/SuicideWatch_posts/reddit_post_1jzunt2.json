People (mostly religious people) have told me that the reason I‚Äôm bisexual is because I was touched as a child by my babysitter.\n\nI was also a victim of domestic abuse and rape by my ex-girlfriend. People have told me that my girlfriend didn‚Äôt rape me because ‚Äúwomen can‚Äôt rape,‚Äù even though she did. \nThey‚Äôve told me that I should have hit back when she hit me, but I was raised to treat women with respect. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to retaliate because I believe it‚Äôs wrong, and besides, she could have turned it against me.\n\nI‚Äôm deeply depressed, not just from what I went through, but also because of how society views male victims of rape. I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. This world is destroying me. ",

I wonder if those guys are better off in ignorant bliss, but ultimately the women go unpunished. \n\nThe ways women predate on victims can be different and more ‚Äúambiguous‚Äù or excusable by society than when a man does it, but predation is predation. It‚Äôs sexist to act like women aren‚Äôt capable of being monsters and like men can‚Äôt be victims to it. Homophobic too tbh, not only treating male victims like they are lesser men, but it‚Äôs often assumed by society female predators are primarily lesbians‚Ä¶ a straight woman couldn‚Äôt possibly harm a man or a little boy, they don‚Äôt even consider bisexual women... Statistically most female predators and pedophiles are primarily straight. Female on male sex crimes. Heterosexuals are the majority of the human population. This reflects in criminal and paraphilic statistics. Male on male sex crimes are highlighted and sensationalized by society, while female predators are mythologized or forgiven. \n\nI‚Äôm sorry to you all. The stuff I experienced from women was very minor in comparison, it changed nothing for me, so I‚Äôm so sorry to hear those women betrayed you.",

Since I have been used and manipulated again and again I have lost my trust but still I refuse to act like a victim all the time like them. I cannot tell you the confusion I get at times by hot and cold behaviours, almost changing identities. Thank You for understanding.
