Then I started to feel like a fucking stalker.\n\nI didn't try to even walk to her. I had to take distance from her, and forced myself to shrug it off. I then saw her with her mom, and I felt even worse.\n\nI have OCD. But I don't think it makes me confuse underage girls online with women in their early twenties.\n\nI remember how I have sometimes seen a hot \"woman\" online.\n\nThen I've seen a post mention she's fucking underage. And she looked over that for me.\n\nI have barely ever gotten such thoughts.\n\nI feel so fucking shit about this. I want to die. What the fuck can I even do to change my brain. It's fucking retarded. Why the fuck do I sometimes find an underage person hot?!\n\nYes, age of consent is a societal construct. Biology is far behind that.\n\nThis doesn't mean it's ok to be a pedophile.\n\nBut what the fuck can I do about this?!\n\nI just realized this about myself. I'm fucking crying now. I am so fucking done with life. I have never been accepted by people because I am fucking ugly and neurodivergent. I am already suicidal. And now I'm also a fucking pedophile. I can't fucking take this. I just want to fucking die. What the hell did I do to be born into such a person?! There's nothing I can fucking do!\n\nI've thought that I've just been always the victim to people. Yeah, I've been done heavily wrong.\n\nBut I also realized that I don't even deserve love or acceptance. I don't deserve hope when I have a brain like this.\n\nNever once have I ever tried to sexually even approach underage people, approach at all.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I found a girl 2-3 years older than me to be attractive. And there were another guy and we kind of played with her and her younger brother. I was underage too.\n\nAnd I've felt so fucking shit about that as well.\n\nI want to fucking kill myself.",

You know, some people experiencing bipolar 2 have disturbing thoughts. Such as pushing an elderly person into a pond or onto a road. I suggest you have a read through the many testimonies online, written by people with personality disorders - this may help you humanise unwanted thoughts. That is what your thoughts are right, unwanted? People experiencing BPD, typically have thoughts of retribution when splitting, most do not act on them and once calmed, feel a great sense of regret and shame at having had such awful thoughts. A therapist will focus on your values, what it is you think about your thoughts, because that is who you are.\n\nAs for messing around when you were a child - I think you may be surprised at just how common an occurrence that is. The Internet is abound with blogs and academic papers on the subject. Again, I recommend you go read the experiences of others, most feel as though they did really understand the connotations of sexual contact - I certainly would not blame a child for lacking maturity and I would not condemn such a person to eternal hell. I would ask them to attend therapy and discuss their unwanted thoughts in a safe, confidential environment. I would support them. \n\nYou have reached out here with profound honesty - please reach out to a professional and keep reaching out here, or in other websites where you might find people have had similar experiences. Build your support networks, focus on your values and keep talking. \n\nI hope something in there helps. Good luck.",

I almost killed myself, I know how you feel, but I promise you, nothing you did was wrong; you walked into a store, and your obsessive brain is twisting it into something creepy. You're already going through a hard time in your life, right? When I dealt with POCD it was during a time in my life where I was extremely isolated and constantly triggered, I think going through an already hard moment in your life can trigger your OCD to become worse. I've noticed POCD is also common is CSA victims\n\nOCD can twist your memories to make you seem worse to yourself, even create completely new ones. I think you should work on grounding yourself and trusting yourself, because I know how easy it is to believe OCD when you already feel horrible\n\nReassurance seeking is okay TO AN EXTENT, don't get in the habit of making posts like this because it will fuel the cycle. Working on ignoring these thoughts would also be beneficial, probably the best thing you can do for yourself even if it's the hardest. I mean COMPLETELY ignore, you can't have ANY compulsive behaviors to them whether it be responding in your head or doing a compulsive behavior in the real world that doesn't even seem like it could relate, but I promise it does.

He didn’t want himself being around his family because they had younger kids and thought he was a monster so he locked himself away in his apartment 24/7.. till he attempted to take his own life and failed at doing so. He then went to the police station and asked them to arrest him and told them the intrusive thoughts he was having and that he was a danger because they weren’t his and some monster or demon had taken over his brain. They just helped him get into a rehab because he was drunk. Anyway, In rehab, that’s where he was diagnosed with OCD.. then they tried hypnosis on him to help him remember things he may have suppressed to protect himself as a child. Anyway, this was really rattling him during the last week he was alive.. he only ever spoke to me about it. He broke down after his third week into it because he had remembered what his uncle had done to him when he would of been a toddler…. He was a mess but finally the most hopeful about those horrible thoughts and saw light at the end of the tunnel cause he knew they were not his noughts and that is where they had obviously been stemming from… anyway, the human brain is so complex that we in a way do chase our traumas in a kink way. He was pushed too far in that therapy in my opinion because he was digging up core memories that he simply couldn’t handle all at once. He died from a drug overdose.. I told his mum the truth right before his funeral when I heard her bring up her brother (who passed from HIV) in a heroic manner. \n\nThe fact that you are identifying these and recognising them as unnatural and not your own is a start in my opinion. A child’s brain is so powerful it will make us forget trauma simply to survive. Perhaps hypnosis therapy with a trusted professional who you can connect with.

I’ve been struggling with this for about 5 years now. It’s a very taboo subject to bring up to therapists and psychiatrists but there are people for everything. It’s called POCD. Do some online research about the subject and maybe even watch some YouTube videos about it. I find them helpful when I’m having down day.

      "body": "Hey, this is totally OCD and intrusive thoughts. This is a super super normal albeit very confusing symptom of it. You are not alone in this or the feelings or the confusion. I am sorry you are already struggling socially and with your mental health. I understand how scary and shameful it can be to have these thoughts and worry about acting on them esp in an area where we have a hard social line. \n\nOCD can be fucking scary. I don't think that gets acknowledged enough. I never want to act in a way I don't agree with and sometimes the intrusive thoughts are way out there and it's hard. \n\nDefinitely there is help for this. You have a lot going on. Please try to be kind to yourself and know that this is a fairly common expression of OCD and I do see I come up here semi-frequently as well. \n\nAlso I know this doesn't always work at all with OCD, but I have OCD and ADHD and am impulsive AF and literally just along for the ride with my brain sometimes. Something that's been helping me is working to separate thought from action, so thoughts and feelings and impulses are going to do what they are doing and will always be there, but with practice and skills and awareness I can recognize when they come and not act upon them. Obviously this is not always possible with all parts of OCD. I still have to switch my socks back and forth many times in the morning because one way causes doom and bad things will happen and the other feels right, so I know NOT acting upon things is also really hard in some aspects of OCD so I didn't want to come across as invalidating in any way. \n\nI guess in that what I am also trying to say is I am not defined by my thoughts and impulses. I have a brain that's kind of a free agent that I live with and work to understand. You are not bad for having these thoughts. Literally probably everyone has these thoughts? What matters generally is what you act upon. \n\nThe fact that you care and are feeling conflicted about this shows you have empathy and care and it matters. It is hard to share with others esp if there is shame or fear involved. Have you found any support for the OCD?",

Maybe I'm confused, but your statement makes it sound like \"real pedophiles\" are insane and that that's why they don't realize that their feelings and urges are bad. And that someone who has the mental clarity enough to understand that it's wrong must, therefore, not be a pedophile. Which obviously isn't the case. \n\nBut back to your statement earlier that real pedophiles don't think there's anything wrong with them: I still have to disagree. Maybe my brain is still just tired from sleep, but it sounds like you're asserting that if someone feels remorse for their feelings or actions regarding their attraction to children, that that makes them not pedophiles, because they're aware of it and feel remorse? And that those who don't feel remorse and/or don't consciously recognize their attraction are somehow the \"real\" pedophiles?\n\n>But I guess this overall depends on each individuals perspective on how an actual pedophile based on their morals and society standards acts like.\n\nI have to disagree with you here. While, yes, there have been tribes known to involve sexual acts with children in certain rituals, that's not current, and it's not a big enough thing to be a part of this issue here. \n\nFor a therapist to diagnose someone with pedophilic urges (for lack of the technical term), those feelings and urges must have been present and persistent for at least the previous six months. \n\nAlso, if one were to poll most Western societies asking their definition of a pedophile, an unfortunate amount of people would say that pedophiles are child molesters, despite that being untrue. So saying that the definition of a \"real\" pedophile should be determined by society or individual peoples' perspectives is just inaccurate and dangerous. There's such a stigma around this paraphilia because people can't seem to research and learn; instead, they would rather stick to the harmful societal views.\n\n(To clarify, I'm in no way condoning the SA of children, but I do think that demonizing anyone that's cursed with that affliction is harmful and keeps them from seeking help before they offend or kill themselves.)\n\nAnd while I do believe that the brain works in mysterious ways, and childhood trauma can indeed imprint itself on the brain in ways that later turn into harmful personality traits and emotional turmoil, I do happen to believe that some (not all, but at least some) pedophiles are in fact born that way. You're right, no one *chooses* to be attracted to children. But while nurture can (and does) have a lot to do with how we end up, nature plays a big role, too. \n\nIt's been a while since I've gone down this rabbit hole of research, but if I remember correctly, it has something to do with a certain part of the brain being different. That could be different from birth (some have suggested excess testosterone in utero), but sometimes it can happen later in life. \n\nI forget the guy's name, but there's a story of a guy in his 40s or 50s maybe who all of the sudden started experiencing sexual feelings and urges for his pre-teen or teenage daughter (or maybe step daughter). Just completely out of the blue. It turned out that he had a brain tumor, and the tumor was right at the part of the brain that's responsible for the lizard-brain things (sorry, my brain's still mush from sleep lol). \n\nAnyway, they were able to remove the brain tumor, and he went back to normal, with no inappropriate thoughts about his daughter at all whatsoever.\nNot long after that, though, he began experiencing those urges again, and it turned out his tumor had come back. \n\nIt's fucked up. \n\nSo yeah, sometimes it's in utero, sometimes it can happen later in life, and, yes, sometimes it can be the result of emotional trauma on a young brain. \n\nBut it's inaccurate to say that every pedophile was molested as a child, because not all of them were. \nBut I think there's also a difference between people who offend because they were brought up thinking it was normal behavior and those that simply have sexual or romantic feelings toward minors, whether or not they act on them. \n\nSimilar to preferential vs opportunistic offenders; preferential ones are intentionally seeking out a specific type of victim, whereas opportunistic ones will just act if a situation presents itself, regardless of their levels of attraction. Which is why not all perpetrators of sexual assault with child victims are pedophiles.\n\nAnyway, yes, I do think that extensive counseling should be free and readily available for anyone experiencing these thoughts or urges.",

They have learned a lot more about the brain and psychology. They are two completely different things and the lgbt community does not accept pedophilia as a legitimate sexuality. It's predatory in nature and being gay isn't being predatory. It's being attracted to someone of the same sex that is capable of consenting.\n\nIt is also more than sex. It is relationship.

BPD is a very demonized diagnosis and lots of times people think they're monsters just waiting to rape and kill everyone in site with no remorse. so, especially for someone with BPD, it's easy to be put on edge about an example being \"murderer has BPD\"\n \nagain, i know that it was just an example because there are serial killers with BPD and someone's BPD can be a factor in them doing that, but it's easy to see it as furthering the hate people with BPD get and saying \"well you know, murderers have BPD\", even if that isn't what you said or meant",
