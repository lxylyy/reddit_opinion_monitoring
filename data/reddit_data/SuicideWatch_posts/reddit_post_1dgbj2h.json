I want to be brave and take decision for myself now and the first thing I want to do is break this marriage , I can only achieve it by being dead\n\n\nEdit : thank you all for your supporting words. Yesterday night I talked with my sister in law about this . How I am suffering and how suicidal I am. Sh was understanding and said kind words, told I should start sharing if I felt like that. I shared how i am not able to get along with him, and she said she understood and told me i should have shared sooner. I felt very relived. I slept peacefullyafter a long time. Today morning she is acting like nothing happened, talking about marriage plans like how we should check out community hall for pre wedding functions, rent a bus for grooms guests,  talking about post marriage things. Talking as if yesterday didn't happen\n\nI'm going crazy, what did I do wrong ? Maybe I was right all along , only death can get me out of this madness\n",

Over a billion people in India and thousands of forced legal marriages happen everyday, horror stories that would arouse riots in the west never see the light of day because of the sheer scale. \n\nPolice and government won't do anything because its perfectly legal and apart of their culture. Indian police are also known to be super corrupt, like see why scam call centres still exist despite doing it blatantly under police noses. \n\nThis is a situation that us foriegners cannot do much about unfortunately, we can't just go over and enforce our values however righteous it may seem which in this case is clearly more right since that would be colonialism.",
