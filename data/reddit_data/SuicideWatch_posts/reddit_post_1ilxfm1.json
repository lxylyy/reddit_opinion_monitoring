Some of us know that at the end of the day, when the lights go out and the noise of the world fades away, all that's left is the echo of our own thoughts and the weight of an existence that never asked to be lived.\n\nThere are no messages of support that can change that. There are no magic words that can fill the void or arms that can embrace what's already dead inside. In the end, the only certainty is that just as I lived in solitude, I will also die in it. And it's stupid for anyone to pretend otherwise just because they're unable to accept the reality of those of us who carry this every day.",
